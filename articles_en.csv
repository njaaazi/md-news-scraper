&#34;Përgjatë dy viteve të fundit, pikërisht me ndihmën e Bashkimit Evropian dhe partnerëve tanë zhvillimor, Shteteve të Bashkuara të Amerikës, kemi realizuar dhe përmbyllur shumë projekte kapitale në fushën e sundimit të ligjit.<br/>
<br/>
Në mesin e reformave të ndërmarra ka qenë edhe qasja në drejtësi për qytetarët e Republikës së Kosovës, të përkthyer në ofrimin e shërbimeve sa më afër tyre përmes profesioneve të lira ligjore.<br/>
<br/>
Që nga themelimi i këtyre profesioneve, askush nuk është marrë me to, as për nga matja e performancës, as për nga nevojat për rritjen e efikasitetit të shërbimeve ndaj qytetarëve.<br/>
<br/>
Kam pasur kërkesa nga komunitetet për t&#39;iu mundësuar qasje në shërbimet noteriale sa më afër vendbanimeve të tyre, dhe kam pasur edhe pyetje parlamentare nga deputetët pse një gjë e tillë ende nuk po ndodhte. Përballë realitetit, reformimi i profesioneve të lira ka qenë ndër detyrat e mia të para si Ministër i Drejtësisë.<br/>
<br/>
Reforma e sistemit noterial ka nisur që në fillim të vitit 2018. Bashkë me BE-në dhe në përputhje me standardet e Bashkimit Evropian, kemi hartuar dhe Kuvendi i Republikës së Kosovës ka miratuar Ligjin e ri për Noterinë.<br/>
<br/>
Në kuadër të zbatimit të ligjit të ri dhe formulës së re 1 Noter në 10 Mijë banorë, në Prill të këtij viti, shumë kohë para se të dorë hiqej qeveria e Kryeministrit Haradinaj, kemi analizuar nevojat e qytetarëve dhe kemi shpallur konkursin publik për rekrutimin e noterëve të rinj.<br/>
<br/>
Rënia e qeverisë e ka gjetur procesin pothuajse të përfunduar. Pra, nuk ka qenë një reformë që e kam nisur aty për aty, por një reformë e domosdoshme që është nisur dhe është zhvilluar përgjatë dy viteve të fundit.<br/>
<br/>
Në fazën e rekrutimit, secili hap në këtë proces është bërë në përputhje të plotë me Ligjin dhe aktet përcjellëse.<br/>
<br/>
Testimi i kandidatëve është bërë në Akademinë e Sigurisë Publike nën vëzhgimin e kamerave, ndërsa testi është përpiluar nga anëtarët e Komisionit Profesional, vetëm një orë para mbajtjes së provimit.<br/>
<br/>
Në përputhje me rrethanat, anëtarët e Komisionit për Dhënien e Provimit të Noterisë kanë shmangur konfliktin e interesit, gjë që është konfirmuar tashmë nga institucioni kompetent për këtë çështje, Agjencia Kundër Korrupsionit me opinionin që kanë dorëzuar tashmë pranë Ministrisë së Drejtësisë.<br/>
<br/>
Në anën tjetër, lidhur me pretendimet për parregullsitë eventuale, ne kemi pritur palë të interesuara, përfshirë Ambasadorë nga vendet e Bashkimit Evropian, të cilëve ua kemi sqaruar në detaje rrethanat dhe ecurinë e këtij procesi.<br/>
<br/>
Prandaj, sot, përballë ftesës së Zyrës së BE-së për pezullimin e emërimit të noterëve të rinj, si Ministër i Drejtësisë vlerësoj se emërimi i noterëve të rinj, mbi formulën që është paraparë si e domosdoshme dhe emergjente për të përmbushur nevojat e qytetarëve, veçmas komuniteteve jo shumicë, është tërësisht legjitim dhe duhet të ndodhë.<br/>
<br/>
Për më tepër, secili nga kandidatët që është testuar dhe ka kaluar fazat e provimit, ka fituar një të drejtë ligjore të cilën unë nuk mund ta hedhë poshtë në mënyrë arbitrare. Një veprim i tillë, do të ishte mesazhi më i rëndë për sundimin e ligjit.<br/>
<br/>
Kemi punuar shumë që të vendosim standarde të mirëfillta të barazisë para ligjit dhe mos cenimit të së drejtës së individëve të lirë të kësaj shoqërie që përfitojnë statusin e tyre në mënyrë legjitime dhe mbi bazën e ligjit.<br/>
<br/>
Ky postulat i domosdoshëm, nuk është subjekt i ujdive politike të askujt dhe të asgjëje. Nuk ka asnjë garanci, as nevojë dhe as arsye që një proces i tillë i nisur dhe realizuar në mënyrë legjitime, të lihet anash e të mos marrë epilog, së paku për ato raste që janë emergjente.<br/>
Për njohuri të opinionit publik, dëshiroj të sqaroj se ky proces do të marrë epilog legjitim në harmoni të plotë me ligjin dhe në partneritet të plotë me Oden e Noterëve të Republikës së Kosovës.</p>",

Në shkollat e Republikës, që janë burim i dijes e socializimit, mësuesit i presin krahëhapur mijëra fëmijë për të ecur bashkërisht me ta në rrugën e ndërtimit të së ardhmes.<br/>
Ky fillim viti shkollor, është akoma më i veçantë. Jam shumë i lumtur që sot në bankat shkollore do të ulen edhe fëmijët e kthyer nga konflikti në Siri.<br/>
Nuk ka qenë aspak e lehtë ta drejtoj një mision të tillë, por kam qenë i bindur se ka qenë vendim i drejtë që të marrim përgjegjësi për këta fëmijë dhe t&#39;i kthejmë në vendin tonë.<br/>
74 fëmijë shqiptarë i kemi nxjerrë nga tmerri i luftës, për t&#39;iu dhënë një mundësi të re si çdo moshatar i tyre.<br/>
Askund më mirë se në shkollë, nuk gjendet një mundësi e tillë.<br/>
Duhet t&#39;i përkrahim e t&#39;i inkurajojmë që të nxënë dije e të bëhen pjesë e jetës sociale që zhvillohet brenda shkollave tona.<br/>
Me kthimin e tyre, jo vetëm që kemi shfaqur një anë njerëzore të vlerave tona si shoqëri, por edhe kemi vendosur një standard të ri në rrafshin global, që sot është referencë edhe për vendet më të zhvilluara demokratike.<br/>

<br/>
Njëzet vjet pas luftës, familjarët ende presin të din çfarë ka ndodhur me të dashurit e tyre.<br/>
<br/>
Në kërkimin e vazhdueshëm për të identifikuar të dashurit e tyre dhe për t&#39;iu dhënë qetësinë e përhershme, familjarët përballen me pritje të gjata dhe me mos gatishmërinë e shtetit serb për të mbyllur këtë kapitull të dhimbshëm të jetës së tyre.<br/>
<br/>
Presioni nga shtetet e Bashkimit Evropian duhet të jetë i vazhdueshëm, në çdo takim me zyrtarët nga Beogradi, deri në hapjen e arkivave dhe informimin e plotë se çfarë ka ndodhur me trupat e qytetarëve nga Kosova.<br/>
<br/>
Pikërisht për këtë gjë, vitin e kaluar me një letër zyrtare, kam kërkuar nga homologët e mi në shtetet anëtare të Bashkimit Evropian që të mbajnë Serbinë përgjegjëse për këtë krim.<br/>
<br/>
Dua edhe njëherë të falënderoj ministren e Drejtësisë të Francës, Nicole Belloube që në letrën e saj i ka dhënë mbështetje të plotë kërkesë sime.<br/>
<br/>
Serbia duhet të dëshmojë se është e gatshme të shkëputet njëherë e përgjithmonë nga politika e Millosheviqit, të respektoj konventat ndërkombëtare, por mbi të gjitha, të tregohet humane dhe të zbardh fatin e 1647 të zhdukurve,  prej të cilëve mbi 100 janë fëmijë</p>",

<br/>
Sot i kam drejtuar një letër homologes sime në Republikën e Maqedonisë së Veriut, Renata Deskoskes, përmes së cilës kam kërkuar lirimin e qytetarit Tomor Morina, i cili është duke u mbajtur në arrest mbi bazën e një urdhër-arresti ndërkombëtar të lëshuar nga Serbia.<br/>
<br/>
Është bërë praktikë politike e pakuptimtë dhe tërësisht irracionale, përndjekja që Serbia vazhdon t&#39;iu bëjë qytetarëve tonë përmes flet arresteve ndërkombëtare, baza e të cilave derivon kryesisht nga regjimi famëkeq i Millosheviqit.<br/>
<br/>
Për më tepër, iracionaliteti i këtyre kërkesave duke u bazuar në juridiksionin inekzistent të saj mbi Kosovën sikur të ekzistonin dy botë paralele, përderisa Republika e Kosovës është shtet sovran dhe askush s&#39;ka të juridiksion mbi të e shtetasit e saj, po e shpërfaqë jo vetëm këtë praktikë, por edhe logjikën e pushtetit të Beogradit si logjikë e përndjekjes së shtetasve tanë për qëllime politike dhe aspak për çështje që kanë të bëjnë me sundimin e ligjit.<br/>
<br/>
Rruga e një shteti që aspiron BE-në e që praktikon një doktrinë përndjekë ndaj qytetarëve të lirë të një vendi fqinje është rrugë që shpie në qorrsokak. Kjo praktikë duhet të marrë fund një herë e përgjithmonë dhe është tepër e nevojshme që në këtë drejtim, Bashkimi Evropian ta ushtrojë presionin mbi Serbinë. Republika e Kosovës nuk do të rrijë indiferent ndaj kësaj çështje, as sot as në të ardhmen, deri kur një praktikë e tillë të marrë fund.</p>",

“These women deserve rehabilitation and hope for a peaceful life, and the place of these children, instead of conflict zones, is school where they shall get proper education on their future. These citizens of ours, especially the children, have been through a period of severe traumatic experiences, but now we shall take care of them so that they overcome such bitter experiences”, added Minister Tahiri.</p><p><br/>
According to Minister Tahiri, the Republic of Kosovo and its Constitution do not deny anyone any fundamental rights, therefore he promised his engagement in rehabilitating and reintegrating these citizens, in order for them to become part of the society.</p><p><br/>
“The realization of this operation, for which we are very grateful to our partners and the security mechanisms in the country, sends a clear message that our state shall not abandon its citizens regardless of their experience. In addition, this sends a clear message that violent extremism, radicalism, and terrorism have nothing to do with us, neither with our tradition and the reality we are part of, nor with our state and social vision, and as such, shall be fought at every turn”, Minister Tahiri concluded.</p><p><br/>

Si Ministër i Drejtësisë dhe përgjegjës për hartimin e politikave publike që fuqizojnë sundimin e ligjit në të gjithë komponentët e tij, përfshirë edhe çështjet e të drejtave të njeriut, konsideroj se Raporti i Departamentit Amerikan të Shtetit paraqet një masë reflektimi për institucionet tona, për të kuptuar progresin por mbi të gjitha, për t’i kushtuar vëmendje të thellë vërejtjeve që janë reflektuar në të gjeturat e këtij Raporti.<br/>
 <br/>
Përgjatë këtij mandati si Ministër i Drejtësisë së bashku edhe me institucionet tjera të sektorit të sundimit të ligjit, jemi përpjekur jashtëzakonisht shumë që me përkushtim të avancojmë politikat tona legjislative që mundësojnë sundim efikas të ligjit, konsolidim të pushtetit të pavarur të gjyqësorit dhe luftim të korrupsionit dhe krimit të organizuar, angazhim i cili është reflektuar në reformimin e drejtësisë penale, pakos së ligjeve të gjyqësorit dhe pakos së ligjeve kundër korrupsionit.</p><p style=""text-align:justify""><br/>
Për të bërë të mundur këtë angazhim legjitim për zbatimin e ligjit, jemi angazhuar po ashtu për të shtuar kapacitetet në sistemin gjyqësor dhe atë prokurorial.</p><p style=""text-align:justify""><br/>
Kemi trajtuar me kujdes edhe përgjegjësitë tona në raport me çështjet që paraqesin kërcenim global, siç është terrorizmi dhe krimi i organizuar trans-nacional, masa të cilat janë reflektuar në Kodin e ri Penal, Ligjin për Konfiskimin e Pasurisë së përfituar me vepër penale, ligjet tjera komplimentare të fuqizimit të gjyqësorit dhe në tashmë draft  Kodin e Procedurës Penale.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">Kemi trajtuar edhe çështjen e integritetit të zyrtarëve publik, përmes masave të reja në Ligjin për Parandalimin e Konfliktit të Interesit si dhe jemi afër përmbylljes së draft ligjeve që rregullojnë aspektet e deklarimit të pasurisë së zyrtarëve publik dhe mandatit të qartë të Agjencisë Kundër Korrupsionit.</p><p style=""text-align:justify""><br/>
I kemi kushtuar vëmendje edhe praktikës së përditshme të zbatimit të ligjit nga agjencitë ligjzbatuese përmes masave të parapara me agjendën ‘Drejtësia 2020” dhe Rishikimin Funksional të Sektorit të Sundimit të Ligjit.<br/>
 <br/>
Përballë të gjitha përpjekjeve tona, ka ende rezistencë për sundimin e ligjit në mënyrë efikase. Vërejtjet e Departamentit Amerikan të Shtetit që janë ballafaqim real me gjendjen në të cilën jemi aktualisht i kam marrë me shqetësim të madh dhe si Ministër i Drejtësisë, brenda mandatit tim ligjor dhe institucional, do t’i adresoj në të gjitha drejtimet.<br/>
<br/>
Korrupsioni, krimi i organizuar dhe performanca e identifikuar si e mangët nga ana e institucioneve tona, duhet të na shërbejnë si alarm për të bërë akoma më shumë në luftimin e këtyre dukurive.<br/>
 <br/>
Do të  vazhdoj të mbetem i përkushtuar që përpjekjet tona për fuqizimin e  sundimit të ligjit dhe luftës kundër korrupsionit dhe krimit të organizuar, të mos rreshtin për asnjë çast dhe që pritjet tona qytetare si dhe përmbushja e përgjegjësive tona shtetërore e institucionale, ta ndryshojnë rangimin tonë, ashtu siç e duam vendin tonë dhe të ardhmen prosperuese të tij.</p><p style=""text-align:justify"">[1] Raporti i Departamentit Amerikan të Shtetit mbi të Drejtat e Njeriut në Kosovë (2018)</p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/03541B29-CB03-4AD7-A988-9A5C3BF53D9C.jpg

Është tërësisht e qartë se vendimet e Kolegjit të Apelit të Dhomës së Posaçme, si pjesë e Gjykatës Supreme, nuk mund të jenë objekt i asnjë shkalle të mëtejshme të ankimimit, përveç se objekt i trajtimit nga Gjykata Kushtetuese, e cila garantohet nga paragrafi 15 i nenit 9 të Projektligjit në fjalë. <br/>
<br/>
Duke marrë parasysh faktin se sipas Ligjit për Gjykatat, Dhoma e Posaçme është pjesë e Gjykatës Supreme si dhe duke marrë për bazë specifikat dhe procedurat e veçanta që zhvillohen në këtë institucion gjyqësor, mungesa e mjeteve të jashtëzakonshme juridike nuk përbën shkelje të të drejtave të garantuara me Kushtetutë (neni 31 dhe 54 i Kushtetutës së Kosovës dhe neni 6 dhe 13 i Konventës Evropiane për të Drejtat e Njeriut). Ky qëndrim është vërtetuar edhe nga jurisprudenca e Gjykatës Kushtetuese, gjatë trajtimit të mëhershëm të pretendimeve të ngjashme.<br/>
<br/>
Nga ana tjetër, projektligji për Dhomën e Posaçme të Gjykatës Supreme jo vetëm se mundëson kalimin e kompetencave të plota tek gjyqtarët vendorë por njëkohësisht ofron alternativa konkrete që rrisin efikasitetin e punës së gjykatës dhe shtojnë nivelin e llogaridhënies së gjyqtarëve për punën e tyre. Përmes ndryshimeve strukturore dhe organizative janë ndërmarrë masa për zbatimin e parimeve të Konventës Evropiane për të Drejtat e Njeriut për një gjykim brenda një intervali të arsyeshëm kohor. Këto ndryshime kanë si synim bazë rritjen e efikasitetit në zgjidhjen e kontesteve dhe reduktimin ndjeshëm të numrit të lëndëve të grumbulluara, që rezulton me zhbllokimin e fondeve të privatizimit dhe ndikon drejtpërdrejt në zhvillimin ekonomik të vendit.<br/>

<br/>
Chairman Isufaj welcomed the JRCB meeting and considered the Board to be a mechanism that provides the opportunity to discuss about the challenges of the justice system, as well as providing opportunities for their solution including monitoring and checking efforts towards these solutions. He said the Board was important because it brings together the key stakeholders from local and international rule of law institutions. Chairman Isufaj once again reiterated his commitment and the commitment of the KPC to continued and further cooperation with all local and international partners from justice system institutions for the purpose of enhancing the efficiency, transparency and accountability of this system.<br/>
 <br/>
In the capacity of the chairman of this meeting and as this was the last meeting held by the Board this year, Chairman Isufaj presented a summary of key points discussed in the meetings of the Board held in 2017 and progress made.<br/>
 <br/>
<strong>Judiciary </strong><br/>
<br/>
Chairman Isufaj spoke about the justice integration process in the North of Kosovo, which was done in accordance with the Brussels Justice Agreement. He noted that during this year they succeeded to integrate 13 prosecutors and 33 administrative staff from the non-majority communities.<br/>
<br/>
Chairman Idrizi esteemed the integration process in the north resulting from the Brussels Justice Agreement. The integration of the judiciary in the north has been completed successfully, with 41 judges and 107 civil servants from non-majority communities appointed throughout the Kosovo judiciary. The KJC has made utmost efforts to provide best working conditions aiming at building professional capacities. In cooperation with the Justice Academy trainings have been organized for those judges, with the judges from the non-majority community currently attending training in the criminal law area at the Justice Academy.<br/>
<br/>
Minister of Justice, Mr. Abelard Tahiri, emphasized that the implementation of the Justice Agreement has been completed successfully, as one of the key achievements of this year. As a result, the unitary justice system has finally been established, functionalizing the justice institutions in the northern part and guaranteeing the rule of law throughout the territory of the Republic of Kosovo.<br/>
 <br/>
<strong>European Reform Agenda</strong><br/>
<br/>
The Head of the EU Office/EU Special Representative, Natalija Apostolova, commended the efforts of the Kosovo Rule of Law institutions made during this year. Apostolova called upon the Kosovo authorities to implement the remaining recommendations from the 2016 European Commission Report on Kosovo - section on “Judiciary Functioning”, and the short-term and mid-term priorities of the European Reform Agenda.<br/>
<br/>
&#34;Reviewing and adopting legislation that will make it mandatory to suspend, namely dismiss public officials that are indicted and convicted of corruption is a priority that the Kosovo authorities have pledged to accomplish within the European Reform Agenda&#34;, Apostolova said. &#34;I encourage the inclusion of required legal provisions in the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code in order to make this possible”.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Abelard Tahiri informed the participants based on the JRCB Agenda regarding the European Reform Agenda (ERA), the Ministry of Justice within its competencies has successfully fulfilled all the obligations arising from the ERA and which have been identified in the Country Report for 2016.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>JRCB Roadmaps</strong><br/>
<br/>
EULEX Head of Mission, Alexandra Papadopoulou, released four JRCB Roadmaps drafted by EULEX in close cooperation with local counterparts and JRCB principals. Each roadmap is a technical action plan with concrete steps that Kosovo rule of law institutions need to undertake in order to ensure the sustainability of local institutions’ capacities as EULEX gradually phases out.<br/>
<br/>
The “Institute of Forensic Medicine (IFM)” Roadmap is focused on technical necessities that need to be complied with in order for the IFM to become an independent institution as outlined in the Law of Forensic Medicine. Some of the requirements deal with finalising the secondary legislation, setting up a proper toxicology laboratory and intensify internal capacity building.<br/>
<br/>
“The Special Chamber of the Supreme Court (SCSC)” Roadmap focuses on improving the performance of the Chamber, and on changing the current SCSC legislation so it can better and more efficiently deal with present and future challenges and sets in place a mechanism that would monitor possible organized crime elements within privatisation and the restitution of judicial processes”, said Papadopoulou.<br/>
<br/>
She emphasised that the third roadmap tackles the issue of the final adjudication of cases related to property lost during the conflict. The “KPA Appeals Panel Roadmap” spells out requirements that are necessary to increase the Panel’s efficiency. In addition, this roadmap foresees the introduction of the mutual legal assistance mechanism (implemented by EUSR) that will ensure that decisions and judgments will finally be delivered to the parties residing in Serbia.<br/>
<br/>
The “War Crimes” Roadmap envisages the creation of the National Strategy and Action Plan for the Kosovo authorities’ work on solving war crimes cases in order to ensure that justice is delivered to the victims and their families.<br/>
<br/>
“EULEX calls upon Kosovo’s institutions to continue to take concrete steps to ensure greater responsibility for building and sustaining an independent and efficient rule of law system”, emphasised Papadopoulou. She thanked everyone for their contribution to the Roadmaps that will start being implemented as of January 2018.<br/>
<br/>
The Minister of Justice informed the participants of the meeting that special attention was given to the Roadmaps as a tool for tracking the progress noted in these areas of rule of law. More specifically, Minister Tahiri presented the contribution and comments of the Ministry of Justice on the four areas identified in the Roadmap.<br/>

In response to this challenge, the Balkan Assessment Recovery Interagency Network (BARIN) held its second meeting in Pristina, Kosovo on the 18th and 19th September 2017.<br/>
 <br/>
Membership of the BARIN Network is comprised of government agencies from eight Western Balkan countries responsible for the management and disposal of assets seized from criminals. The member jurisdictions are; Albania, Bosnian-Hercegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.<br/>

AMSCA is the Asset Management Office (AMO) for Kosovo. <br/>
 <br/>
At this first meeting the participants agreed to establish a regional network to enhance its members cross-border capabilities to manage assets suspected to be derived from criminal activity. The practitioners in BARIN will also exchange of good practice in the field of sequestration, management and confiscation of criminal assets in order to develop their own national laws and procedures in this field.<br/>
 <br/>
The second meeting was again hosted by AMSCA from Kosovo, supported by the EUO in Kosovo and funded by Technical Assistance and Information Exchange (TAIEX) from the European Commission.<br/>
 <br/>
The theme of this year’s conference was ‘Pre-Seizure Planning’. Input on this subject was provided by practitioners from the Dutch AMO, the Belgian AMO, and a private company contracted by asset recovery units in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.<br/>
 <br/>
Each member jurisdiction provided an update on the establishment of their own AMOs and an overview of inter-agency cooperation with respect to the management of seized criminal assets.<br/>
 <br/>
Kosovo will hold the Presidency of BARIN throughout 2017. Upcoming Presidencies will be FYR Macedonia in 2018 and Bosnia-Hercegovina in 2019.

The following are the brief points regarding the Draft Law on Disciplinary Liability of Judges and Prosecutors<br/>
Main points</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">•    The disciplinary procedure is based on Croatia&#39;s model. This model has also been agreed with the EU and the US.<br/>
•    The Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC) and the Kosovo Prosecutorial Council (KPC) are responsible for initiating investigations and imposing disciplinary measures for judges and prosecutors.<br/>
•    Citizens&#39; complaints against judges and prosecutors are submitted to the following competent authorities:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">1.    the President of the Court where the judge is employed concerning a judge,<br/>
2.    the Chief State Prosecutor where the prosecutor is employed concerning a prosecutor,<br/>
3.    the President of the Supreme Court concerning a President of a Basic Court,<br/>
4.    the Chief State Prosecutor concerning a chief prosecutor,<br/>
5.    the KJC/KPC concerning the President of the Supreme Court and the Chief State Prosecutor.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">•    The Competent Authority reviews the complaint within 30 days and dismisses it if it is not grounded, does not involve disciplinary violation or is statute barred. If the complaint is grounded, the Competent Authority submits to the KJC/KPC the request for the initiation of investigations.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">•    The investigation of judges and prosecutors is carried out by an investigative panel established by the KJC/KPC. The panel consists of three judges when a judge is the subject of investigation, and three prosecutors when a prosecutor is the subject of investigation. The investigative panel collects evidence and submits to the KJC/KPC a report on the basis of which the KJC/KPC imposes the disciplinary measure. Against the decision of KJC/KPC appeal is allowed before the Supreme Court as the last instance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">•    The Ministry of Justice and the Ombudsperson are not entitled to investigate the judges/prosecutors, to impose disciplinary measures against a judge/prosecutor, or to dismiss the decisions of KJC/KPC.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">•    The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Ombudsperson have the following competencies:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">1.    In case a President of the Court/Chief Prosecutor, in violation of the law, does not review the complaint of a citizen, MoJ/ Ombudsperson has the power to request from the KJC/KPC the initiation of investigations against him/her for disciplinary violations.<br/>
2.    In case a President of the Court/Chief Prosecutor, in violation of the law, dismisses the citizen&#39;s complaint, the MoJ/ Ombudsperson has the power to request from the KJC/KPC the initiation of investigations on the case dismissed.<br/>
3.    In case the KJC/KPC does not take a decision on the disciplinary measure within the legal deadline, MoJ/ Ombudsperson has the power to request the protection of legality before the Supreme Court.</p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/4825EE8B-AFB4-489D-9738-BCE5038933FF.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/A31462C6-1853-4182-9CEC-0DD3FE4ABAB9.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/B15248E3-CA23-4940-8ACA-71CB7089EE68.jpg "

“We have built the architecture of justice, we have good and democratic laws, and we have professional judges and prosecutors provided with good conditions for independent, impartial and professional work. We have set standards in justice in order to make it more functional”, said Deputy Minister Munir Basha, adding that now is the time to have functional justice and win the trust of citizens.<br/>
In his speech, Mr. Basha emphasized that guaranteeing and protecting citizens&#39; rights, and combating corruption and organized crime are the prerequisites that Kosovo must fulfil as a modern and democratic state governed by law and order. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
“Although the Ministry of Justice has very limited powers in the work of the prosecution and the courts, we are committed to assisting in establishing better policies for the functioning of the rule of law system in our country”, emphasized Deputy Minister Basha.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It should be noted that the review of criminal and anti-corruption legislation is part of the activities for 2017, in addition to efforts in amending and supplementing the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, as well as anti-corruption laws, namely the drafting of the Concept Paper on Anti-Corruption Agency and on the Declaration, Origin, and Control of Property. Moreover, a working group was established for the drafting of the concept paper on “Review and adoption of legislation that makes the suspension and/or dismissal of public officials accused and convicted of corruption mandatory”. At the same time, Deputy Minister Basha said that it is worth mentioning that the Ministry of Justice has drafted the Draft Law on “Prevention of Conflict of Interest in Discharge of Public Functions”, which is already in the Assembly. This draft law was drafted in full compliance with the EU legislation and was done in cooperation with representatives of the Anti-Corruption Agency, experts from the Council of Europe, and the EU Office in Kosovo. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Concrete measures will be taken with regard to the presentation of the findings and recommendations, especially in the process of reviewing the Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, and in particular the anti-corruption legislation” emphasized Deputy Minister Basha, while underlining that during the process of Functional Review of the Rule of Law Sector the institutional capacities of stakeholders involved in the fight against corruption will be particularly addressed in order to implement, coordinate, and further strengthen the measures to be taken against this ugly phenomenon. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
“Our country needs to strengthen its institutional capacity in fighting corruption, money laundering, and terrorist financing in line with the European standards. This is best achieved through the efficient absorption of technical assistance and assessments that will be modelled on GRECO and MONEYVAL methodologies”, added Deputy Minister Munir Basha, pointing out that we are on the right path in marking progress towards strengthening the rule of law, which is a priority of the Republic of Kosovo as the only path towards integration into European structures.<br/>

Proposals for the criminal sanction of “Defamation of the constitutional organs and state symbols” (Articles 134/C and 134/D) have been taken from the Criminal Code of FR of Germany, a member state of the European Union and the Council of Europe, known for its highest standards of respecting human rights. Moreover, other European Union countries such as France, Italy, Poland, Greece, Lithuania, Portugal, and Slovenia, among others, have similar criminal provisions that punish defamation of constitutional organs and state symbols.  By 2018, Germany will remove the provision on defamation of the foreign head of state, but not the defamation of the President of Federal Republic of Germany, which will remain a criminal provision.<br/>
 <br/>
Freedom of speech, including criticism of state institutions, is a fundamental right guaranteed by Constitution, and an inalienable basis for a democratic constitutional order. On the other hand, respect of the constitutional organs and state symbols require that criticism be grounded and not serve for humiliating and insulting purposes, which would not contribute to a constructive discourse. The Ministry of Justice is of the opinion that public debate as such can be carried out without insults and defamations that are contrary to our culture and tradition.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice has offered several proposals for the Criminal Code in order to initiate public debate, which would take place in accordance with the government’s Regulation of Rules and Procedure on drafting legislation. All the proposals on amending and supplementing the Criminal Code will become public and the possibility for public debate will be provided. However, given the recent media debates, and prior to the initiation of public consultations on the Criminal Code it its entirety, the Ministry of Justice publicly invites all the prosecutorial and judicial institutions, the bar association, the civil society, the media and academic institutions to provide their opinions, proposals or reviews regarding the following Articles:<br/>
 <br/>
Article 134/C<br/>
Defamation of the state and its symbols<br/>
1.      Whosoever publicly, in a meeting or through the dissemination of written materials:<br/>
1.1.       insults or maliciously expresses contempt of the Republic of Kosovo or its constitutional order; or<br/>
1.2.     insults the colours, flag, coat of arms or the anthem of the Republic of Kosovo, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three (3) years or a fine.<br/>
2.      Whosoever removes, destroys, damages, renders unusable or defaces, or otherwise insults by mischief a publicly displayed flag of the Republic of Kosovo, or a national emblem installed by a public authority of the Republic of Kosovo, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding three (3) years or a fine.<br/>
3.     Whosoever by the act intentionally supports efforts against the continued existence of the Republic of Kosovo, or against its constitutional principles, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding five (5) years or a fine.<br/>
4.      The attempt to commit a criminal offense set forth in this Article shall be punishable.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Article 134/D<br/>
Defamation of the constitutional organs<br/>
1.      Whosoever publicly, in a meeting or through the dissemination of written materials defames a constitutional organ, the President, the Assembly, the Government, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Kosovo, or one of their members in this capacity in a manner detrimental to the respect for the state and thereby intentionally supports efforts against the continued existence of the Republic of Kosovo, or against its constitutional principles, shall be liable to imprisonment from three (3) months to five (5) years.<br/>
2.      The criminal offence provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article may only be prosecuted upon the authorisation of the constitutional organ or member affected.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
For the sake of transparency, the said Articles as well as the received opinions, proposals, and reviews will be published on the official website of the Ministry of Justice.<br/>
 If, after exhaustive debates, still dominates the stand that it is reasonable for constitutional organs and state symbols to be defamed and insulted and not be subject to criminal sanctions, then the Ministry of Justice will act accordingly.<br/>
 <br/>
The Ministry of Justice welcomes any opinion, proposal, and review on the proposed Articles in writing via zkp.md@rks-gov.net by 15 May 2017.<br/>

The Ministry of Justice is in the process of reviewing the criminal legislation (Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code) with the aim of advancing the field of this legislation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
Through this process, above all, we aim to further advance the legislation in this field in general, focusing on revising the provisions that refer to strengthening the constitutional system of the Republic of Kosovo; to strengthen the fight against terrorism, corruption, and organized crime; to address the challenges and difficulties encountered by the criminal law enforcement agencies, and to address the findings from the European Commission’s country report.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
Upon receiving the comments and proposals, and establishing the working group on this issue, the Ministry of Justice prepared the initial draft of the Draft Law on Amending and Supplementing the Criminal Code.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
In preparing this draft, the Ministry of Justice took into account the proposals of the stakeholders involved in this process as well as the good practices of the European Union countries in general, and Germany in particular.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
Some of the articles proposed for discussion by members of the working group regarding the strengthening of the constitutional system of the Republic of Kosovo, have been modeled on the German Criminal Code, which is in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the practice of the European Court of Human Rights, and as such are subject for review by the working group and do not constitute proposals of any institution, therefore, the working group established on this issue will be competent to address and recommend how to proceed with this issue.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
At present, the draft has been sent to the members of the working group, representatives of civil society, and our international partners.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice is currently in the stage of receiving additional comments and proposals from the members of the working group.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice is deeply committed for the review process of criminal justice to be comprehensive and transparent in order to further advance the current legislation, so that the law enforcement bodies be provided with adequate legal infrastructure and that their work be as effective as possible in preventing and combating negative phenomena.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice invites all parties and the media to refrain from prejudices and understand that the proposed issues are currently at the level of discussion and are just proposals to be decided by the working group.<br/>

GOVERNMENT PROTECTS THE LAWFULNESS OF KOSOVO BAR ASSOCIATION,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/909AC725-18CA-4D61-94B7-85662B743129.png ,24/04/2017 19:27,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The said Decision is based on Article 44, paragraph 1 of Law no. 04/L-193 on the Bar, which stipulates: “The Government of Kosovo supervises the lawfulness of general KCA acts and is authorized to suspend the application of an act that is in conflict with the law, until the competent court makes a decision on it. This supervision is limited to the adherence to the law and legislation, by not violating the administrative autonomy of the KCA.”</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Regulation suspended by the Government was approved on 30.06.2016 by the Kosovo Bar Association and is the result of a cooperation agreement between the Kosovo Bar Association, the Kosovo Judicial Council, the Kosovo Prosecutorial Council, and the Kosovo Police for the establishment of a coordinating mechanism for litigation defense at public expense in the criminal cases, concluded on 26 April 2016.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
This Regulation was disputed by a group of lawyers who submitted the assessment of the lawfulness of this regulation to the competent court, and also required from the Ministry of Justice to initiate the procedure for suspension of the implementation of the regulation until the court renders a decision on this case.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
Moreover, the provisions of the Law on the Bar do not foresee the issuance of such an act by the Kosovo Bar Association. Furthermore, this regulation derives from a cooperation agreement, whose provisions foresee some limitations for lawyers, such limitations being in violation of the provisions of the Law on the Bar, and particularly Article 54, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which stipulates:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
 “Only a member of the Chamber of Advocates of Kosovo may be engaged as defense counsel, but an attorney in training may replace the member of the Chamber of Advocates. If proceedings are being conducted for a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment of at least five years, an attorney in training may replace a member of the bar only if he or she has passed the judicial examination. Only a member of the bar can represent a defendant before the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court of Kosovo.”</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice has also consulted the representatives of the Bar Association in order to find a solution to this issue.<br/>
Furthermore, the Ministry of Justice is in the process of reviewing criminal justice (Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code) and in this case expresses its commitment to discussing and reviewing any matter, including issues specified in the said regulation, and thus invites the parties involved in this dispute to submit their proposals.<br/>

The functional review will focus on three aspects which are considered as problematic for an efficient, transparent, and accountable rule of law system in service of the citizens.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
 “First, we are dealing with the sectoral strategy that affects the rule of law sector. We have a considerate number of laws, but there are numerous criticisms that they are not consistent and that there are contradictions among them, which makes their implementation difficult and sometimes even impossible”, said Minister Hoxha.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The second aspect, emphasized Minister Hoxha, is the review of the transparency, accountability, and efficiency level of justice institutions, whereas the third aspect is the review of the level of cooperation and communication between justice institutions and law enforcement institutions, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Police, Customs, Kosovo Intelligence Agency, and the Ministry of Finance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
Minister Hoxha stated that the functional review of the rule of law sector incites transparency, accountability, and efficiency of justice institutions in view of the European integration agenda and that without proper cooperation and communication between justice institutions and law enforcement institutions there can be no effective rule of law.<br/>

Today, the Draft Law on Execution of Penal Sanctions has been approved in the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo. On this occasion, the Minister of Justice, Dhurata Hoxha, emphasized that the adoption of this draft law is of particular importance because it prevents political interference in the execution of penal sanctions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">“With this draft law we prove that we really are for reforms, rule of law, and a system of international values and principles”, said Minister Hoxha.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Minister specifically noted the amendment to Article 94 of the Law, according to which the Minister, as a political appointee, had the competence to suspend the execution of the sentence and thus was considered as an opportunity for political interference in justice.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This issue has now been solved and such competence has been vested on the court, as a competent institution. We consider that, except being in accordance with the constitutional principles, this solution is in conformity with international standards and an important step towards the separation of powers, wherein the court decides on the sentence and the possibility of suspension, whereas the Ministry of Justice only executes such decisions”, said Minister Hoxha.<br/>
The Law on Execution of Penal Sanctions has begun implementing since 2013, and during its implementation several obstacles and difficulties have been encountered and the Ministry of Justice, through this draft law, aimed at eliminating such shortcomings in the execution of penal sanctions.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The draft law contains provisions referring to the issue of conditional release, including the composition of the conditional release panel, the possibility of appealing the decision of the panel, the health care for the convicted persons, the provisions referring to the compassionate leave, the suspension of imprisonment sentence execution due to health reasons, the early release of the convicted person, and the harmonization of the provisions of this draft law with the reforms envisaged by the Law on Minor Offenses.<br/>

The Ministry of Justice shall have no power to discipline judges and prosecutors,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/378559DC-E38F-4C2A-9C2B-CF01BA04ACE0.png ,18/04/2017 19:22,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Ministry of Justice would like to clarify the public that the Draft Law on Disciplinary Liability for Judges and Prosecutors has not yet been finalized. Following the consultations with the presidents of the courts and the state prosecutor, Kosovo Judicial Council, Kosovo Prosecutorial Council, the Ombudsperson, civil society, as well as international partners, the Ministry is preparing a draft law which will be finalized in the near future. Any document that may circulate in public is not final but only a draft document for the consultation purposes with the relevant stakeholders. Based on this, the comments that are based on these draft documents are premature and misguided.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice would like to clarify the public that based on the recommendation of the European Union in Kosovo, the Croatian model of disciplinary liability shall be taken as the foundation which will then be adapted to the institutional circumstances and conditions in Kosovo. According to this model, despite the premature comments, the Ministry of Justice shall have no power to discipline judges and prosecutors. This power is exclusively vested on Kosovo Judicial Council and Kosovo Prosecutorial Council, as defined by the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, presidents of the courts, state prosecutor, Ministry of Justice, and the Ombudsman, as well as the citizens of Kosovo will be entitled to file a request with the Kosovo Judicial Council and Kosovo Prosecutorial Council to initiate investigations against a judge or prosecutor, if there are grounds that they have committed a disciplinary offense. The investigation shall not be carried out by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, but by a disciplinary commission established by the Kosovo Judicial Council and the Kosovo Prosecutorial Council respectively. When investigating a judge, the disciplinary committee shall consist of judges serving in other courts, whereas in the case of a prosecutor from prosecutors serving in other prosecutor offices, hereby addressing complaints of judges and prosecutors on being investigated by officers of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel who have no experience in judicial proceedings or prosecutors’ duties. Moreover, this office is also criticized by international partners for their lack of transparency and accountability. The final decision to discipline judges and prosecutors is vested on Kosovo Judicial Council and Kosovo Prosecutorial Council respectively, against which legal protection may be initiated before the Supreme Court. Decisions shall be published to increase the transparency of the process.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
The Ministry of Justice would like to ensure the public that they are finalizing the draft law in close cooperation with international partners, particularly the US, and are considering EU comments and recommendations, including documents on international and European standards, especially those of the Council of Europe, in order to achieve the highest standard of efficiency. For this reason, all parties are invited to refrain from premature and unsustainable comments in order not to mislead the public. The Ministry of Justice specifically invites the media to be directly informed in the Ministry on current developments and to refrain from unfounded reporting that may only serve to interest groups for whom a responsible, transparent, and efficient judiciary is not convenient.</p>",

“We, as a society and state, are combating corruption, but now is the time to increase our efforts in this fight. We should not be satisfied with laws only, we should not be satisfied with rhetoric in combating corruption either.

The problem of corruption is not a problem that cannot be addressed, nor an impossible fight. However, we all need to do more in this fight, including institutions, citizens, civil society, and also the media.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>
 “I firmly believe that one of the most effective ways in combating corruption is by increasing transparency. To this end, I would like to take this opportunity to ask for the assistance of civil society and the media.

 “Speaking about these crimes is among the most difficult topics for each of us, for damages caused by these crimes, starting with the suffering of victims, affect us all as persons responsible for the institutions we lead, but first and foremost they affect us as humans.

As for the war crimes, said Minister Hoxha, it is painful for all of us that even 18 years after the war, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, spouses, and children are still left in the dark.

Press release by the Ministry of Justice,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/4479E8E4-76E6-40B7-A483-75DAB2F8C27A.png ,16/03/2017 19:13,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This decision is based on the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo and the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Kosovo, dated 17 February 2008, wherewith the Republic of Kosovo was declared an independent and sovereign state. As an independent state, and according to the rules of international law, the Republic of Kosovo has automatically inherited ownership of state property of Yugoslavia and Serbia as defined in the decision of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo. This has been confirmed by the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement (&#34;Ahtisaari Plan&#34;), which has been incorporated as an integral part of the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. According to this document, “movable and immovable property of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the Republic of Serbia located within the territory of Kosovo at the time of this Settlement shall pass to Kosovo” (Article 8.3). Considering that the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement entered into force upon entry into force of the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo, then movable and immovable property of Yugoslavia and Serbia located within the territory of Kosovo shall automatically pass to the Republic of Kosovo.<br/>
For this reason, the Decision of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo only requires the rectification of cadastral records so that they reflect the legal situation created automatically upon the entry into force of the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo. The Decision shall be implemented by the Kosovo Cadastral Agency in accordance with the applicable laws.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ministry of Justice would like to clarify to the public opinion that the need for the rectification of cadastral records has emerged in 2014 when the Ministry of Justice began the process of drafting a concept paper on the law on public property. The concept paper discussed the need to define the issue of state succession of immovable property of Yugoslavia and Serbia.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The issue of state succession of immovable property and rectification of cadastral records in order for Kosovo to be registered as the owner of properties still registered in the name of Yugoslavia and Serbia, was raised again during the consultation stage of drafting the strategy on property rights in Kosovo. This process began in 2015 and was led by the Ministry of Justice with the support of USAID. In the context of the first thematic group, which was responsible for analysing legislation regarding property and legal rights in Kosovo, the problem of property registered in the name of Yugoslavia and Serbia was identified and it was recommended that this property be treated according to the international law. The Working Group highlighted that the fact that in Kosovo there is still immovable property which, despite the rules of international law, is registered in the name of Yugoslavia and Serbia affects public property of the Republic of Kosovo, creates legal uncertainty and impedes the use of these properties for the needs of economic and social development of Kosovo. The relevant analysis and the recommendation later became part of Kosovo National Strategy on Property Rights, which after being finalized by the Ministry of Justice was adopted by the Government in December 2016.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the adoption of this strategy, namely in October 2016, the Ministry of Justice already started consultations with the Kosovo Cadastral Agency and the Privatization Agency of Kosovo for the identification of properties still registered in the name of Yugoslavia and Serbia and which should be passed in the name of the Republic of Kosovo. The Kosovo Cadastral Agency presented a list which was reviewed by the Privatization Agency of Kosovo in order to exclude social property under the administration of the Privatization Agency of Kosovo. After clearing the list and preparing the draft-decision, the Ministry of Justice in November 2016 submitted the decision to the Government. Following its review, the Government requested that the list be supplemented with more factual data regarding the parcels in question and therefore returned it to the Ministry of Justice for review.

Joint Rule of Law Coordination Board presents the Compact Progress Report 2014  ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/EA8CE93E-3DC5-4A9A-868E-0EC27452335D.jpg ,11/06/2014 18:36,"<p>Today, Deputy Prime Minister Kuci, the EUSR/Head of the EU Office Samuel Zbogar and EULEX Head of Mission Bernd Borchardt jointly presented the ‘Compact progress report 2014’. <br/>
 <br/>
It marked an important moment: With the decision on new EULEX’s mandate, Kosovo has underlined its continued firm support for the Mission as well as its commitment to strengthen the rule of law. While important steps will be taken in transitioning EULEX’s mandate, the three Co-Chairs of the Joint Rule of Law Coordination Board confirmed that nothing has changed in their joint Compact commitment: the setup of sustainable, accountable, independent and multi-ethnic rule of law institutions, free from political interference and adhering to international recognised standards and European best practices. <br/>
 <br/>
The Head of EULEX, Bernd Borchardt, referred to a number of concrete examples of progress, such as the establishment of a new Regional Police Headquarters in the north or progress in the Financial Investigation Unit, but also underlined that more needs to be done. He referred to agreed roadmaps to strengthen rule of law institutions, whose implementation was partially hampered by the lack of financial and human resources. “EULEX stands ready to support Kosovo. EULEX is an essential tool of the EU to help Kosovo to build rule of law and move on its path towards the EU,“ he underlined. „The focus of the next two years will be on ´working together´. Based on the Compact, our partnership will be further strengthened.”<br/>
 <br/>
The Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Justice, Hajredin Kuçi said that Kosovo has reached a number of important objectives and that he feels that Kosovo institutions are now strengthened and more capable in addressing rule of law challenges. “As a result we are undergoing a process of transfer of competencies from EULEX authorities to Kosovo institutions. Increased competencies indicate also more responsibilities on Kosovo institutions to continue strengthening their capacities and ensure a sustainable and efficient justice system. Therefore, the Compact tracking mechanism serves also as a tool to identify the challenges and address them further”.<br/>
 <br/>
The Head of European Union Office/EUSR, Samuel Žbogar stressed that the EUSR/EU Office and EULEX stand ready to support local institutions in their efforts to tackle the rule of law issues. “Whilst the EU gives a breadth of assistance to Kosovo’s Rule of Law institutions through project assistance such as IPA, Twinning and TAIEX, the Compact Progress Report plays an especially important role in highlighting technical progress in fulfilment of benchmarks set out in the EU approximation process”, Žbogar said. <br/>
 <br/>
The Compact was signed on 12 November 2012. The Joint Rule of Law Coordination Board (JRCB) is the main forum to discuss joint rule of law topics and to oversee the implementation of the Compact. The Compact supports Kosovo’s EU integration processes, which include the Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the Stabilisation and Association Process Dialogue and the Structured Dialogue on the Rule of Law.  <br/>
 <br/>
Both, the CPR and the underlying Compact Tracking Mechanism, which has concrete indicators that identify tasks and progress made so far in all related areas of the Compact, are available at the EULEX website.</p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/EA8CE93E-3DC5-4A9A-868E-0EC27452335D.jpg

<br/>
The meeting was focused mainly on developments that occurred in Kosovo in recent years in the area of ​​rule of law and in other areas, the process of dialogue with Serbia, Kosovo&#39;s EU integration process in the EU and other regional and international organisations including United Nations.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi informed the Assistant Secretary-General Mulet on the latest achievements in Kosovo, namely developments and structural and functional reforms in the judiciary, the process of dialogue with Serbia and the integration of northern Serbs in Kosovo institutions. <br/>
<br/>
Kuçi presented concrete developments in European perspective, as MSA agreement and visa liberalisation, stressing that Kosovo institutions have almost fulfilled the obligations arising from these processes and further added that they are committed to fulfil all obligations arising from agreements in question. <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Kuçi stressed that Kosovo is now entering into a development stage with a clear European perspective and that the UN and specialised institutions in Kosovo, are among the main partners, thus expressing the intentions of Kosovo for UN membership, which according to him, would guarantee Kosovo citizens equal rights with citizens of the region and beyond. <br/>
<br/>
Assistant Secretary-General Mulet said he is very impressed with the positive developments that have taken place in Kosovo in recent years. He said that &#34;in general we are seeing a very encouraging picture and we are impressed with the processes that have been developed. The contribution of the UN and the EU has been great, but it is obvious that Kosovo institutions are those that have done the most for the development of the country &#34;.<br/>
<br/>
He also said the UN supports the dialogue with Serbia and results of this dialogue, emphasising that the integration of Serbs in the north is a very important process and national elections are the best opportunity to testify this integration. <br/>
<br/>
The mutual cooperation between the UN, through their representatives in Kosovo, was also discussed, while the parties stressed the need to continue with the cooperation in various fields of common interest, in particular in the field of further strengthening the rule of law, namely a greater commitment to the implementation of legislative framework is already drafted. </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/7F613A62-7E20-4E1E-9C82-A8DF451CEC00.jpg

The meeting was hosted by Samuel Žbogar, EU Special Representative and Head of the European Union Office, and co-chaired by Bernd Borchardt, EULEX Head of Mission, and Hajredin Kuçi, Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo and Minister of Justice. <br/>
<br/>
The meeting convened to take stock of Kosovo\&#39;s technical progress in the rule of law area, in particular with respect to fulfilling Roadmaps on War Crimes, Witness Protection, Prisoner Escorts, Forensic Medicine, the KPA Appeals Panel, and the Special Chamber of the Supreme Court. The highlight of the meeting was the announcement that the latest version of the Compact Progress Report will be released on 13 June. <br/>
<br/>
The chair of this meeting, EUSR Samuel Žbogar stated:<br/>
<br/>
\&#34;We are facing a period of significant change; institutional changes, changes in the political landscape, and changes in resources. And all this coinciding at a time when there is an accelerating impetus to transition more responsibility to local ownership. The Compact has proven to be a valuable tool for our cooperation, and with a new government just a short time away, we must give thought to how we can evolve our collaboration over the coming months to adapt to the new landscape.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst the existing international presence in Kosovo begins a process of scaling down, the people of Kosovo can rest assured that the European Union remains devoted to fostering Kosovo\&#39;s future. The difference will be that increasingly, local institutions will be in the driving seat. EU expertise will be less intrusive: Specially targeted IPA projects will continue to support notable gaps in local capacity or expertise until those gaps can be adequately filled by the local institutions themselves. My office will continue to offer guidance on strategic priorities and problem solving. But ultimately, it is in Kosovo\&#39;s own interest to take control of its own future; to pinpoint needs, to weigh benefits with costs, and to take full responsibility for planning, structuring, budgeting and implementing of its strategies.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the outcome of the elections may be, the European Union presence in Kosovo will continue to support Kosovo to ensure that its path to Europe remains unerring.\&#34;<br/>
<br/>
Deputy-Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Hajredin Kuçi reaffirmed Kosovo\&#39;s support for the Rule of Law and said: <br/>
<br/>
\&#34;The contribution of the EU and EULEX in the field of the Rule of Law in Kosovo has had a significant importance in the strengthening of the Rule of Law. The Kosovo Institutions have had a great cooperation with EULEX in all the fields of law which has resulted in strengthening the capacities of the local institutions and the rule of law in general. <br/>
<br/>
The transfer of competencies from EULEX to Kosovo shows that there are increased capacities of the local institutions in fighting crime and the undertaking of such competencies will increase the responsibilities of the local institutions. Today we have discussed regarding many aspects of such process that aims at creating a justice environment that offers equal access to justice to all the citizens of Kosovo. <br/>
<br/>
The Kosovo institutions remain committed to continue the fight against crime in all forms and shapes. Together with the representatives of EU and EULEX we have expressed our commitment to continue enhancing the cooperation with all relevant stakeholders in the general effort to further strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo.\&#34;<br/>
<br/>
The Head of EULEX, Bernd Borchardt stressed the importance of the Compact, stating: <br/>
<br/>
“This meeting of the Joint Rule of Law Coordination Board provided us with the opportunity to review and discuss progress registered on our common endeavors.  The recent agreement to extend our mandate for another two years is a clear position supporting the rule of law in Kosovo and a signal of renewed partnership between Kosovo and EULEX. This is the last meeting before Kosovo elections and the end of EULEX current mandate. We look forward to a new momentum in our cooperation, and ensured today continuity in our partnership. The focus of the next two years will be “more together, for Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
In this spirit we reviewed our recent commitments and identified areas that still require attention, for example the Roadmaps on War Crimes, the KPA/KPCC, Prisoner Escort for the Mitrovica/Mitrovicë Basic Court, and on Forensic Medicine. While some parts of these agreed Roadmaps have been implemented, we highlighted the work which remains to be done. Likewise, I want to stress the common work on up-dating the anti-corruption matrix which identifies problems to be solved in Kosovo ownership. <br/>
<br/>
We also continued our discussions about Kosovo´s particular challenges with political interference in the rule of law and agreed that a concrete set of measures should be prepared for our next meeting. <br/>
<br/>
Together we took note of the Government of Kosovo’s commitment to work in the coming weeks to overcome the underlying challenges. We stand ready to support Kosovo in its work on these challenges and are confident that, working together, these challenges will be overcome.”</p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/9D8C47AB-3228-4360-8E21-00A12D54E928.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/C022A432-03D3-47E0-AA48-4C84DE0EF1F7.jpg "

Not coincidentally today, as 6 years ago, when we solemnly signed the draft constitution we have chosen this place that symbolizes the temple of knowledge and the castle from which ran and were defended our rights as a nation and as humans. Even our Constitution is a product of the entire struggle for freedom and equality, of the mind and the will that had as a source the inspiration of generations of our people for decades. Even inscription 6 years of Republic and Constitution is a sign of respect to the many voices that sounded the student youth in demonstrations for Republic and Constitution. So today, we remember with pride and respect everyone who with their lives and work made it possible for us to be free, independent and prosperous along side of the free nations of the civilized world. This already realized goal shows that we have reason to celebrate, and that we are lucky generation.<br/>
<br/>
Nations who survive and free people are differed on many things, but above all: in the lifestyle, in means they use to achieve their goals, in perception about life, in the vision for the future, in the longevity of actions, in frequent delusions and improvising they make, in national cohesion, but above all in the values ​​they build and are identified by. It was the year 1999 that switched from non-freedom to freedom, the year that showed that we survived as a people and as a nation, and was the declaration of independence on 17 February, that realized centuries of aspirations of our people and was only this Constitution that set the norms of values of the state building by aspirations of all generations over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>
Adoption of the Constitution more than a legal and political act was intended and noble act for our country. Six years ago, members of the Assembly being privileged when they adopted this Constitution, they had the sense of historical responsibility of reflection of goals of the will of our citizens, but also building a vision for the future. At that time, there were mixed feelings about the Constitution because we had the burden of responsibility of functioning of our just declared state, his obligations towards the citizens and international partners, but today I am convinced that every one that voted that day feels happier and proud of the work done that day. As the strengthening of freedom and independence clarifies the contribution of each individual, as well as the strengthening of our state, democratic institutions, the rule of law in the spirit of the Constitution, strengthens the assurance of the job well done with high responsibility that given to us at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>
Our Constitution, though new in tradition, is proving that it is serving as the firm foundation of a modern state, whose priority is to protect and guarantee the highest level of rights and freedoms of its citizens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
During the years that passed, our Constitution was challenged very often. But in each case, this constitution proved that is built in such a way as to guarantee a control and equality system that functions regardless of situations and political mathematics, which is the supreme quality of a Constitution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Proper checks and balances system that is created by our Constitution, has made it possible that despite difficult situations which our country has passed and may pass through, the best answer will be given exactly by the this Constitution and the balanced system itself that it has created. We should mention here with high appreciation the contribution of each citizen and institution, the work of the Constitutional Court, which through successive requests of institutions, but especially our citizens, has made it possible for the hand of justice of this Constitution to be extended to every citizen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most of the work of each of us, the Government, the Parliament, the judiciary and other institutions, civil society in our country, in the future will also be to ensure that the rights intertwined in our Constitution will be feasible for every citizen. This means the construction of such mechanisms that prevent misuse of these rights bay one side, either an institution or an individual. We should strive to maximum to guarantee the award, but also the limitation of authorizations for the governing bodies, transparency of institutions, but without harming reliability; to enable independent operation of governing bodies without losing their accountability, to guarantee freedom of expression, but without allowing the slandering; guarantee religious freedom, but without jeopardizing our state secularism; guarantee free market, but without damaging the customer; guarantee equal opportunities and the removal of discrimination, but without damaging the employer; guarantee protection for the country and the people, but without risking isolation from others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>
<br/>
The life of a nation and a country is more evolving then legal acts are. Same, our country&#39;s political developments are reflected in the amendment of the Constitution these years, and were quite normal and in line with our goals; same was in the conclusion of the supervised independence, same was in the transformation of the KSF, same it may be in the new political arrangements. I say, when a law is not exactly suitable to the people the law should change not the people, it applies in this case and in the times to come. But I am convinced that our country&#39;s basic values ​​established in this Constitution shall remain as such and will resist for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
In the capacity as Minister of Justice, but also the former Chairman of the Constitutional Commission, I express my appreciation for institutional support, express the gratitude for the hard work of the members of the Constitutional Commission, the seriousness and responsibility for professional opinions and open debate among them and citizens at that time, for continuous work on protecting the work done during these years. I felt lucky to have worked with you, and those years I have taken that time and teamwork as a model. I must express great sorrow for the absence of two members already passed, deputy head of the Commission, Mrs. Nekibe Kelmendi and member Mr. Ramadan Kelmendi.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal in the Constitutional Commission was to have a Constitution that respects the rights of each individual, starting from the premise that one will never be truly free until all people can enjoy the same freedoms. We have openly and strongly set values ​​that should rule our state that are comparable to the civilized world. For these 6 years our Constitution has been observed that helps democracy, democracy of equal opportunities for all, for free and complete development, that does not deny anyone&#39;s values, but that helps in the creation of common values, planning of the future for us and generations to come or how would Montesquieu say: &#34;no purpose more beautiful than to work for the people who come after, to be happier than we were.&#34; I believe that we have achieved this<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I want to reiterate that, respecting the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo and the rule of law is not only the institutions&#39; of Republic of Kosovo duty, but is a mission of all citizens of the country. Respecting the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo nowadays is of course more advanced than in the years prior to its entry into force for the reasons stated above and as a result of conviction and trust created by citizens. All of us would like that the respect of the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo and the legal system in general would come more and more from their faith and conviction than by the state activity in order to respect them in our country<br/>
<br/>
Let us believe in the work and the sublime values ​​of our state and Constitution, let us enhance and protect those values, let us intertwine them with the national interest and democratic world and be part of it our by our political and legal identity. <br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and happy the Constitution Day! </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/0FF218CB-07A2-409F-81C7-F34714A136DC.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/E0CF7621-0AC6-4604-989C-9A7A153DF65B.jpg "

Third meeting of the Structured Dialogue on the Rule of Law - 16 January 2014 Operational conclusions,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D14BFD48-ABFD-4C05-A46C-9D1EB2F44895.jpg ,10/02/2014 18:12,"<p>The representatives from Kosovo and the EU met for the third time in the framework of the Structured Dialogue on the Rule of Law (Brussels, 16 January 2014). This Structured Dialogue offers an opportunity for high-level political discussions related to Justice, Freedom and Security, and Judiciary and Fundamental Rights. The meeting featured discussions concerning the judiciary and judicial reform, independence of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and corruption and the effective prevention of corruption.<br/>
<br/>
There was agreement that considerable achievements have been made by Kosovo in 2013, but also that there are many important challenges still to be addressed. The European Commission, EULEX and the EUSR/Head of the EU Office assured their full support and continued commitment to assist Kosovo to address these challenges. <br/>
<br/>
Kosovo assured their high political commitment and determination to meet the objectives in the rule of law, a commitment which was also demonstrated by the progress made. The EU side emphasised that increased efforts are needed from the Kosovo authorities on the implementation of the jointly agreed Compact actions, which are reflected in the roadmaps discussed in the meetings of the Joint Rule of law Coordination Board (JRCB) and monitored through the Compact tracking mechanism.<br/>
<br/>
Both parties recognised progress is being made in terms of strengthening the capacities of the Kosovo institutions. Kosovo recognised that the continued support provided by the EU is important, assisting the strengthening of capacities of Kosovo institutions to perform better and more effectively the responsibilities prescribed by law. <br/>
<br/>
In order to improve further and target better the EU support under IPA 2, Kosovo will prepare by the end of April a three year comprehensive rule of law assistance strategy and action plan. This strategy will allow the EU and other donors to provide strategically targeted assistance to Kosovo in the future, and it should support and prepare Kosovo to gradually assume more rule of law-related responsibilities.<br/>
<br/>
On the implementation of judicial reform and the harmonisation of legislation Kosovo reported that the harmonisation of the laws on the judiciary, with the involvement of all stakeholders, has been concluded and draft amendments have been sent to the EU for comments. A joint Judicial Council-Prosecutorial Council working group has been set up to make an assessment of the implementation of the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code. A significant investment in financial and human resources has been made recently increasing the number of judges and prosecutors, including in the special prosecution office. While recognising the relative smooth transition to the new court and prosecutorial structure in 2013, the European Commission emphasised the importance of an inclusive process when harmonising or drafting legislation. The Commission also underlined the need for more attention to be given to case management and data processing in the judiciary, to improving access to justice for minority communities and to the proper handling of - often sensitive property rights cases. <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the independence of judiciary the EU side expressed concerns about public comments made on specific cases, especially regarding final judgements, aimed at the independence of the judiciary. The EU strongly expressed the view that the fundamental principle is to refrain from interference; public comments by high level officials can have the effect of being interfering, threatening or intimidating. The EU encourages Kosovo to respect better the principle of the separation of powers which is laid down by the Constitution and the relevant legislative framework. This issue will be further discussed in the context of the Joint Rule of Law Coordination Board.<br/>
<br/>
Kosovo confirmed its policy against open intervention in the judiciary and agreed that individual court cases should not be discussed in public. The Judicial and Prosecutorial Councils stated that the independence of judiciary is incontestable and they have stepped up measures to act upon public or media statements which can be seen as interfering in the judiciary. Coordinators in charge of media and public relations have been nominated in the basic courts and prosecutorial offices, which is important for the public perception on the independence of the judiciary. There are improved security and protection measures for judges and prosecutors; next step is to ensure those measures are implemented and also made applicable to relevant staff, plaintiffs and witnesses. <br/>
<br/>
In order to address the problems in the Correctional Services identified by the 2013 Progress report, the Ministry of Justice, in cooperation with EULEX, has established a task force that will monitor the performance of this service and will work towards addressing the problems.<br/>
<br/>
Kosovo institutions reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate better in the fight against organised crime and corruption, whilst agreeing that organised crime and corruption remain amongst the biggest challenges, to be addressed with absolute priority. <br/>
<br/>
The needs to make progress to provide concrete evidence of results in fighting organised crime and corruption, as well as improve the reliability of statistics is reflected in the 2012 Feasibility Study Kosovo. Kosovo institutions have established a tracking mechanism for the harmonisation of statistical reports concerning the fight against corruption, organised crime, trafficking in human beings, trafficking in arms, trafficking in narcotics, money laundering, as well as concerning the confiscation and sequestration of assets. The Prosecutorial Council has prioritised the handling of corruption cases, through the adoption of an action plan addressing the lack of efficiency of the prosecutorial system on corruption cases; a national coordinator has been appointed to monitor the implementation of this action plan.<br/>
<br/>
Kosovo presented improved statistics in the fight against organised crime and corruption. The key for achieving progress in these fields lies in actions and in commitment; it concerns the implementation of the adopted legislation and strategies and the good functioning of the cooperation &amp; tracking mechanisms. <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the fight against corruption in general and the fight against corruption in public procurement in particular, Kosovo is requested to look into the need to streamline and improve the complex institutional set ups, as well as into the development of e-procurement. </p>",

Speaking on the activities of the Ministry of Justice in the fight against corruption, deputy Prime minister, Kuçi said:<br/>
<br/>
\&#34;As I have said in the past meetings, the fight against corruption is not an easy task, but a challenge for all institutions. I take this opportunity to thank the representatives of all the institutions present for their contribution and cooperation in this field. Fight against corruption remains one of the highest priorities of the Government of Kosovo and one of the prerequisites for the process of European integration. We further express our dedication and willingness to take all the actions to coordinate the anti-corruption activities with a zero tolerance policy.<br/>
<br/>
During the discussions at our last meeting and also during the work of the working groups, we, as Ministry of Justice, have been committed to take all the necessary steps in preparing the necessary legislation in ensuring more effective fight against corruption.<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to inform you that we have drafted (amended) the \&#39;package of laws against corruption\&#39;, respectively the Draft Law on Amending and Supplementing the Law no. 04/L-050 on Declaration, Origin and Control of Property of Senior Public Officials and the Declaration and Origin of Gifts of all Public Official, and the Draft Law on Amending and Supplementing the Law no. 04/L-051 on the Prevention of Conflict of Interest in the Exercise of Public Function.<br/>
<br/>
These draft laws have already been approved by the Government and proceeded to the Assembly, therefore I believe that the Assembly will very soon proceed with the adoption of these laws.<br/>
<br/>
Through amending and supplementing these laws will be achieved the harmonization of anti-corruption legislation with the legislation in force, namely the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, which has been one of the requirements arising from the working groups within the Council. No doubt that these amendments have meet the requirements that have emerged from the long and substantial consultations with the Anti-Corruption Agency, institutions, local and international organizations and the civil society in Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
I am convinced that these two draft laws will have a very positive effect in preventing corruption and abuse of official duty. Following the adoption of laws, we as a Ministry, will take all the necessary steps for an easier implementation, and will draft the necessary sub-legal acts in order to guarantee an easier implementation of these laws in practice.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue of particular importance in the fight against corruption is the initiative for the \&#39;Establishment of the national office for the coordination of the work of the institutions in combating economic crimes\&#39;. Along with some of the participants in this meeting we agreed to establish a National Office for the coordination and monitoring of the activities of relevant justice institutions in pursuing the perpetrators of criminal offences with economic benefits. One of the primary goals of this office will be monitoring the work of relevant institutions in the process of seizure/confiscation of property resulting from criminal acts and their proper management.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that the functioning of this office will increase the efficiency of the institutions involved in the fight against economic crime and will minimize the possibilities of misuse of confiscated or seized assets.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, on behalf of the Ministry of Justice and on behalf of the Government, let me express our willingness to cooperate in the field of fight against corruption\&#34;.</p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/7EAAA871-FCB3-4F35-84B0-0B099053EC81.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/FC800A50-9FA4-432A-BCCB-10D7627E2ACF.jpg "

 <br/>
After the meeting, Mr. Haber stated:<br/>
 <br/>
“I have come to Kosovo today to express solidarity and sympathy with my colleagues on the ground. This is a tragic event and it is important that EULEX staff on the ground know that they are supported and valued by the highest leadership levels in Brussels. Today is a day that we remember our fallen colleague Audrius Senavicius, and I earlier this morning visited the Logbase at Mitrovica where I met with others involved in the incident and opened a book of condolences for Mr. Senavicius. I have every confidence that our police and judicial personnel, working together with the Kosovo police and judicial institutions, will conduct a thorough investigation into the tragic event of yesterday, and that they will also investigate thoroughly other incidents that have occurred, such as the event in Bosniak Mahala this morning. I note that this morning our police and customs officers went to their duty stations in the north. This is a tremendous demonstration of their professionalism and dedication.”<br/>
 <br/>
Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi said:<br/>
 <br/>
“I would like to take this opportunity to offer my condolences to EULEX and to the family and friends of Mr. Senavicius. The Government of Kosovo stands ready to offer every assistance to EULEX through its rule of law institutions. We are already co-operating well together in the joint police investigation on the ground. I am pleased to note that this morning both Kosovo Border Police and Kosovo Customs personnel were able to travel to their duty stations in the north as per usual. We will not be deterred by this crime from implementing the IBM agreement.”</p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/DAAB549A-6DA6-46F8-91A5-273014B8CABF.jpg

Kosovo does not have a list of persons to be arrested,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D14BFD48-ABFD-4C05-A46C-9D1EB2F44895.jpg ,19/09/2013 17:57,"<p>The Government of the Republic of Kosovo expresses its concerns regarding yesterday’s speculative declarations on the existence of a list of people that are planned to be arrested by the Kosovo authorities. The recent media reports on the alleged existence of such a secret list containing the names of Serbs are unfounded speculations that are part of an orchestrated propaganda that aims at obstructing the peaceful and democratic processes.<br/>
<br/>
Such speculations are against the spirit of the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia and hinder the implementation of the agreement on the normalization of the relations reached on April. As such, the misinformation broadcast throughout the media are not  to the benefit of the citizens of Kosovo or those of Serbia.  <br/>
<br/>
The Republic of Kosovo fully respects the international legal order and the international standards in all the criminal proceedings that are initiated in accordance with the procedures envisaged by the legislation in force.<br/>
<br/>
On that regard all potential criminal cases are investigated and dealt with individually, on their merits, and by the relevant judicial and prosecutorial authorities acting in accordance with Kosovo law.  In no way should they be used as part of  a  propaganda campaign. </p>",
" Press Freedom: Rights, Responsibilities and the Public Interest",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D14BFD48-ABFD-4C05-A46C-9D1EB2F44895.jpg ,19/09/2013 17:56,"<p>Hajredin Kuçi and Bernd Borchardt </p><p><br/>
There is no doubt about it: a free press is a cornerstone of any democracy, particularly fragile or developing democracies. Along with elections, it is a key accountability tool. Elections happen only once every four years. Government happens every day. So, there must be a free press to assist in holding Governments and public officials to account between elections. A free press, when acting to hold governments or public officials to account, should be acting on behalf of the people, acting in the public interest.</p><p>A free press is frequently very powerful. Many newspapers in many countries have carried stories that have revealed political excess, ineptitude or fraud. Many times this has led to individual and collective resignations, changed policies, or legislative reform. That’s what a free press should be doing: holding up public officials to scrutiny, and when things are being done wrongly, or done in a way that damages the public interest, informing the public about it.</p><p>And there are many fine journalists in Kosovo who are doing just that – investigating stories that may damage the public interest, in the public interest.<br/>
That is not to say that many elements of the press in Kosovo don’t have influence: they do. They shape public opinion, they frame the agenda. They sell stories that the public are interested in. But do they always act in the public interest? Is it really better for the public to know who the witness in a trial is and what he or she says, or is it the final conviction of a wrongdoer that really serves the interest of the public? The answer to this question should be simple.</p><p>It is clearly in the public interest for Rule of Law institutions, still in their infancy in Kosovo, to flourish. It is clearly in the public interest that the new laws of Kosovo are allowed to take root. Legal history is being made in Kosovo on a regular basis. We recently saw the first plea-bargains being entered in a human trafficking case. We recently saw the conclusion of the trial on the state’s first co-operative witness. We recently saw the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals effectively set and then confirm new Kosovo jurisprudence (defining what various laws mean in practice) – on the intimidation of witnesses and obstruction of justice through public comments.</p><p>Kosovo’s legal system, like other legal systems, relies on witness testimony.  Witnesses, by their very nature, are vulnerable and often fragile people. They frequently live in fear of delivering testimony. It is in the public interest – the interest of Kosovo - to ensure that any witness is enabled to deliver their testimony.<br/>
Unfortunately, it seems the opposite is the case: witness intimidation is rife in this country. What to some people seems a game, to a person who is trying to serve justice when needed, is a life threat. A witness who has made an important decision, to testify and see justice being done, should indeed be praised instead of being publicly intimidated for their courage.</p><p>Intimidating a witness is not merely done by directly threatening a person. In a place like Kosovo, a mere publication related to the morality of his/her testimony is enough of an intimidation necessary for them to, refuse to testify or fear for their lives.<br/>
It is to be regretted that this has happened in Kosovo. Many journalists believe that they are serving the interest of the public in publishing information that should be kept confidential, such as witnesses, suspects or any other information about the investigation or trial. However, it is indeed standardized in many countries around the world, that in such cases, priority is given to the proceedings. Other countries in the region have Press Codes that recognize this.</p><p>For example, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it specifically notes that Newspapers and periodicals shall generally avoid identifying witnesses in court trials for war crimes, as well as identifying their relatives and friends. The Press Codes of Norway, Austria, Albania, Denmark and Bulgaria all have similar provisions around the privacy of persons involved in court proceedings.</p><p>This is done because, indeed, the interest of the public indeed relies upon seeing justice being done, seeing perpetrators sentenced and seeing its society grow with a lower crime rate. And while it is indeed in the public interest to know more about certain major trials, the priority should be that justice is served. A just trial is one that is fair to the public, to the citizens. It is unfair to the public to deny them the right to justice by publicly intimidating witnesses, obstructing evidence and trials, in the name of the people.</p><p>With the power of press freedom also comes responsibility. It is morally and ethically wrong and irresponsible to print the names of witnesses, photographs and personal details, which could cause fear for their lives and families and stir public opinion to a level that obstructs justice. Such acts de-motivate people to cooperate with the police and judicial institutions, while the institutions are trying really hard to be trusted with this cooperation. It is unforgiveable and disgraceful to publish inaccurate information about those witnesses. And it damages the public interest of developing strong Rule of Law institutions in Kosovo.</p><p>There is a place for polemic. There is space for investigative journalism. But there is no place for willful intimidation of witnesses, past, present and future.  There is no place for obstruction of justice to be done in the name of the people, who indeed are the ones who look forward to seeing a successful trial and conviction of a wrongdoer. The people of Kosovo deserve better. Our judicial institutions, who dedicate their lives to fighting crime, deserve better. The people of Kosovo are interested to see justice being served. The judicial institutions should be enabled to do so.</p>",

<br/>
The Minister thanked the Swiss state and the International Institute of Notaries for the given assistance to this project, the Judicial and the Prosecutorial Councils for their cooperation and commitment.<br/>

Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi asked from the Roma community to pay a greater importance to education,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/550B439C-6CE4-4B89-9E9B-8D3A4D9A120B.jpg ,08/04/2013 17:43,"<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, today took part in the marking of the International Roma Day, organized by the Office of Community Affairs and the Office of the Prime Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi said that whenever it comes to the Roma community and their rights, often incomplete, it should be discussed in the international context, not just the local. According to him, the Kosovo Roma do not enjoy ideal conditions for their lives, as the other part of the population, but they are improving day by day. <br/>
<br/>
&#34;It should be noted that rare are the countries which have a Strategy on the Government level of caring to achieve up to 100% of the Roma community rights. Kosovo already has this. Furthermore, it should be recalled that the discussions on the implementation of this strategy is set on two levels even higher than the government one: it has been discussed on its implementation even in the Visa Liberalisation Dialogue and the Structured Dialogue on the Rule of Law&#34;, said Kuçi.<br/>
<br/>
Deputy Prime Minister said that on this day I want to regain the attention of Roma community towards schooling and education of its members, adding that Kosovo has more room for the members of the Roma community to get educated and emancipated in many possible social dimensions, but without risking their community common values, tradition and culture.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Deputy Prime Minister said that the Government of the Republic of Kosovo is working every day to ensure the highest level of respect for human rights. He added that this is not only declarative, but there have also been established mechanisms to ensure its implementation in practice. </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/550B439C-6CE4-4B89-9E9B-8D3A4D9A120B.jpg 
The Bar Examination is very important for the justice system in Kosovo,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/7EDD5696-4FFD-464A-A0A9-452E45B3FCA1.jpg ,05/04/2013 17:42,"<p>In a ceremony organized today by the Ministry of Justice, have been certified 41 candidates who have passed the bar exam in March 2013.<br/>

In this ceremony attended by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, the U.S. Ambassador in Kosovo, Tracey Ann Jacobson, the Head of Executive Division in EULEX, Mats Mettsson, heads of justice institutions, and other guests, was emphasized that the bar exam is very important for the legal system in Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
On this occasion, Minister Kuçi said that the candidates who have passed the bar exam will have more weight and responsibility because in a near future they could be leading the structures of justice. <br/>
<br/>
&#34;Lots of work is in front of all us. The judiciary and the prosecution need more professional, but also patient, knowledgeable, young, and cautious judges. This is especially now that, as the Minister of Justice, I have taken the initiative to decrease the extremely tough criteria for admission of judges and prosecutors in their positions. We will do this just to give you, and many other young lawyers, as well as those lawyers who until now have worked in different fields, an opportunity, such as in the academy&#34; said Minister Kuçi.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi reiterated that this year should be a year of improving the image of justice and the year of implementation of law. He said that during the two past years, the Ministry of Justice in cooperation with its close partners, as the Embassy of the United States of America, KJC, KPC, EULEX and many others, have enabled an easier reform of the legal infrastructure.<br/>
<br/>
Ambassador Jakobson said the candidates who have passed the bar exam take on additional responsibilities toward the society, as they will represent the society in the role of a judge or prosecutor. According to her, the candidates will contribute in respecting the constitution and laws, as well as in strengthening the rule of law.<br/>
<br/>
Head of the Executive Division in EULEX, Mats Mettsson, stressed the importance of the work of these candidates for the rule of law in Kosovo in the future.<br/>
<br/>
On the importance of the Bar Exam, as the first step in involvement into the justice system, spoke also the President of the Supreme Court, respectively the Chairman of the Committee on the Bar Examination, Fejzullah Hasani, Chairman of the Kosovo Judicial Council, Enver Peci, and the Chief State Prosecutor, Ismet Kabashi. According to them, passing the bar exam offers candidates a step closer towards the involvement in the Kosovo judicial system. </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/F02C55AD-6081-48D4-9B78-6F03490D5134.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/F60825E8-99D1-4FA5-BEC5-EFC8237CE36F.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/1516B889-9D08-47B4-AF88-F13F24E762AF.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/7EDD5696-4FFD-464A-A0A9-452E45B3FCA1.jpg "

This project is part of a broader EU support in improving standards and performance in the field of legal cooperation. International legal cooperation in criminal justice enables effective prosecution, effective trial of national and international crimes, as well as the prosecution of organized crime and terrorism.<br/>

Deputy Minister, Xhemajli said that one of the main challenges in the field of rule of law is the international legal cooperation, as an important criterion for the Process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Visa Liberalization.

At the meeting, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, took part the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi.<br/>
<br/>
In his address to the participants, Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi said: &#34;Let me express the readiness of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo for the European Union integration process with a special focus in two directions in 2013 - meeting the criteria related to the Stabilisation and Association agreement and the criteria related to the visa liberalization process. Both of these criteria represent priorities for the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, and I can say that the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, respectively our institutions have already met the short-term criteria, and we are now focused on the med-criteria and expect to get a positive result.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, except the issuance of the Law that has to do with the protection of witnesses, we have also issued other laws such as the Law on confiscation of illegally obtained property, the anti-corruption strategy etc, therefore, I thank the Assembly of Kosovo and other parties for their support. We have also issued the administrative instructions or the secondary legislation for the implementation of these laws. Moreover, let me point out that the Kosovo Police has intensified its commitment in the fight against organized crime. Only during the second half of 2012 it has made over 329 investigations, over 120 police operations and over 382 arrested persons. Kosovo Police is also committed to fighting human trafficking and drug trafficking, and it can be concluded that it has reached tangible results and now we have over 392 suspects, 249 arrested and 179 convicted persons from the second half of 2012. We have increased the international cooperation in the field of investigation. In particular we have had a special cooperation with EULEX, including the requirement for maintaining the competences in the Special Prosecutor&#39;s Office, as required by the Stabilisation and Association process.<br/>
<br/>
We have signed a compact agreement with EULEX in this direction and we already have specific commitments on EULEX monitoring the recruitment processes of senior appointments, in particular in the Kosovo Correctional Service, the Kosovo Police, as well as for judges and prosecutors. Kosovo Judicial Council and Prosecutorial Council are present and let me emphasize that they have accomplished their obligations in the appointment of judges and prosecutors, at the start of the new organizational structure as well as in the application of laws, in particular the two codes, the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code. We have made commitments in the area of public administration reform and on 7th December 2012 we have also approved the secondary legislation.<br/>
<br/>
The protection of minorities has been one of our priorities, and now we have a committee to monitor the implementation together with the Ambassador of Greece and some other relevant ministers who take care of the cultural heritage in Kosovo, in particular the Serbian one. In the process of visa liberalization, concrete steps have been taken in meeting the criteria of the roadmap and 68 out of 95 are left and we expect that there will be concrete commitments in their implementation by June this year. Immigration policy and visa controls are processes that are already in place in the Republic of Kosovo and this will be respected in particular by achieving success until June or until the meeting of the Council of Ministers. The Government of the Republic of Kosovo awaits the fulfilment of tasks and knows that there are tasks on which work must be done together with the other local actors, but also expects a positive result in the integration process of Kosovo into the European Union, regardless the fact that there are some states that have not yet recognized Kosovo as a state, but supported the integration process and I believe that we will have a two-way journey in the process.&#34; </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/A9A957C7-FFD3-4C14-8530-965F469020F0.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D34218EE-E091-4712-8CC6-DE322A7FBCDB.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/A87EFED2-F0E8-4E8E-BDB6-791626E37168.jpg "

<br/>
After the meeting they held a joint press conference where Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi said: &#34;Let me to express my satisfaction about the meeting that we had with Commissioner Fule, and thank him for visiting the Republic of Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
We must accept the fact that the visit of the Commissioner Fule is good news for our country, and that Commissioner Fule, within this month, has met twice the officials of the Republic of Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
Let me say that every meeting with Commissioner Fule presents an overview of our achievements in the field of European integration, but also in taking on the obligations which are directly related to our integration process.<br/>
<br/>
Today we have talked about three specific issues, which I will briefly describe. The first is associated with the process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and I have to say that the Republic of Kosovo has met the short-term criteria, and now we are at the phase of awaiting concrete steps from the European Commission in the month of April. I believe that in the coming months we will be able to start such a process which is of extremely great importance for Kosovo. In this process, we will continue with the fulfilment of the med-term criteria. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, discussed the visa liberalization process, emphasizing in particular the requirements that the institutions of Kosovo, and also all the other mechanisms in Kosovo must meet. We also are looking forward to an acceleration of both the processes, meaning that while we meet our obligations, EU institutions also ensure that this process is as fast, as short, and as effective as possible, and in compliance with our obligations. <br/>
<br/>
The third inevitable topic, which relates to the visit of the Commissioner in the region, has to do with the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. On behalf of the Government of Kosovo, I expressed the readiness of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, so that tomorrow we will be constructive in the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia. Therefore, the Government of the Republic, namely the Prime Minister, is ready to reach an agreement between our two countries, with good intentions, to have peace, stability and the normalization of relations between our two countries. <br/>
<br/>
Naturally, we are always conscious of respecting Kosovo’s sovereignty, its territorial integrity, the Constitution and the legal system of our country.<br/>
<br/>
We are contributing in this direction and we will be extremely careful. Let me express our admiration for the role the EU is playing, in particular that of Ms Ashton in the dialogue process, and also the direct contribution of Mr Fule in the process of European integration, and in the dialogue process.<br/>
<br/>
We know that we have obligations we must carry out for the EU, but we are also convinced that the EU has willingness for the Kosovo&#39;s integration process, where we even belong, and where we should be as a country, as well as the region as a whole. Once again, let me welcome Mr Fule and thank him for his visit in Kosovo. &#34;<br/>
<br/>
Minister Çitaku said: &#34;It is always a pleasure to meet with Commissioner Fule, who despite the challenges which the EU enlargement policy is facing today, continues to be a champion of inclusion and membership of all the countries in the big European family.<br/>
<br/>
We assured the Commissioner that Kosovo will continue to work hard to ease his task and to assist him in being able to push forward Kosovo’s European agenda.<br/>
<br/>
A relationship that has recently been defined by us, is now taking on a concrete form, after the Feasibility Study and the fulfillment of short-term criteria by our side. We anticipate the materialization of this relationship, and respectively entry into contractual relations by the signing of a Stabilization and Association Agreement, as the first step toward EU membership.<br/>
<br/>
We are aware that we have a long road ahead of us. Kosovo continues to face challenges. We continue to share many problems with countries in the region. But we are very willing. There is no doubt at all that the practice of enlargement is based on lessons learned and Kosovo’s challenges are sometimes very large and complex.<br/>
<br/>
However, it is important that at the end of this process, regardless of how long and challenging it is, Kosovo will have built all European values and principles within it. <br/>
<br/>
Kosovo is very lucky to have a strong political consensus. I informed the Commissioner that meeting the short-term criteria in such a short period of time would not have been possible without the broad support of opposition parties for the European integration process. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, we discussed the visa liberalization process, although this does not fall directly within Commissioner Fule’s brief. <br/>
<br/>
However, the European Commission office in Prishtina, and EULEX are an added value for Kosovo in this process. We have already developed our common roadmap in order to jointly share our duties and fulfil them as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Partnership is the key word, and I am very pleased with the partnership we have with the Commissioner, and also his structures here in Prishtina &#34;.<br/>
<br/>
Commissioner Füle said: &#34;It is a pleasure to be here today - in a key moment for the European future of Kosovo. If you have observed more frequent contact between Prishtina and Brussels, this indicates the level of commitment on both sides, to moving Kosovo forward on its European path.<br/>
<br/>
I have just met with my two colleagues, Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi and Minister Çitaku and will soon meet with President Jahjaga. My main message to them and to the whole of Kosovo is that - I support your efforts in the dialogue with Serbia and appreciate the progress made in meeting the short-term priorities deriving from the feasibility study for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
This progress is the result of the hard work of Kosovo. It is vital to maintain this momentum and continue this progress because it is on this basis that the Member States will decide for the in June on the next steps. &#34;<br/>
<br/>
The following days and weeks will be vital for the EU-Kosovo relations. A possible agreement with Belgrade tomorrow and its implementation in the terrain will lay out the path for a positive conclusion at the Council’s meeting in June on the negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
The Prime Minister has worked hard to reach this moment. Now he needs the support of everyone in Kosovo which is in the interest of all its citizens. Because, being European means being willing to compromise and also make consensuses.<br/>
<br/>
I will soon deliver the same message to the National Council on European Integration and the joint meeting of the Assembly Committees on European Integration and Foreign Affairs.<br/>
<br/>
Kosovo needs to show more courage now. More effort is required in the field of rule of law, with regard to the fight against organized crime and corruption, electoral reform and economic development.<br/>
<br/>
The continuation of reforms and the improvement of relations are two sides of the same coin. Without them, Kosovo cannot thrive, prosper and be at peace with itself and with its neighbours on its path towards Europe. I am sure that you can succeed and you have our constant support. &#34; </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D250D204-45ED-4A01-BB84-2AE5BD71AA1A.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/C3ADC3F0-BAEA-4C0C-965F-F7F0A4687ADC.jpg "
Minister Kuçi offered the full support of the Government in clarifying the fate of missing persons,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/59F92D08-3ABD-4768-A193-14D39D2A2197.jpg ,18/03/2013 17:31,"<p>Today was held the meeting of the Governmental Commission for Missing Persons, which has been attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, who expressed the willingness of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo to help the process of identification of missing persons.  <br/>
<br/>
&#34;On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo, I guarantee you our full logistical, financial and political support. The issue of missing persons has been a priority for us in our direct contacts with the political actors, the international ones and even with those of Serbia. In this case I mean the legal, institutional and budgetary basis that we have created, by doing a good job coordinated by law. The process has begun to take the desired direction, therefore I thank the Governmental Commission for Missing Persons, and in particular the families of missing persons for the work done.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi reiterated his suggestion that every municipality should have one officer who would be engaged on missing persons and said that he will send a written request to all the municipality mayors regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
Minister emphasized that keeping contacts with Serbia is very important, since each information would be useful in clarifying the issue of missing persons and in this regard, Minister Kuçi announced that the Government of Kosovo is willing to even pay compensation in case of any accurate information on mass graves. He said that the Government is ready to do research on every part of the country, if there is suspicion of a mass grave, but he added that he expects the same thing from Serbia, too.<br/>
<br/>
At this meeting, Minister Kuçi said that there will be no normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, without the identification of missing persons. He said that this issue has been discussed in the three meetings of the dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade held in Brussels. </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/DFC21986-C38D-4446-9472-4613C1011AF6.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D7ECA0D3-146E-4260-9087-A7D39C3612EC.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/59F92D08-3ABD-4768-A193-14D39D2A2197.jpg "

This memorandum was signed by the Deputy Minister of Justice, Abdul Ymeri and the General Director of the Kosovo Police, Shpend Maxhuni.<br/>
<br/>
The Memorandum aims the creation, development and promotion of cooperation between the Ministry of Justice - KPS and the Police of the Republic of Kosovo, in exchanging information and providing support for the execution of measures and alternative sanctions and supervision of conditionally released persons, in accordance with the applicable legal provisions. </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/F332C65A-1B43-404F-B6F1-E0538BA8D6E5.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/8E8DD88A-BEBA-4F99-80F7-0200186F6E18.jpg "
Minister Kuçi reiterates the importance of the issue of missing persons,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/4C0EC68A-2B49-4DE0-AD9A-986FE21F2FB1.jpg ,15/03/2013 17:29,"<p> Today, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi hosted a delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross Office in Prishtina, headed by Lina Millner. At this meeting were present the Chair of the Intergovernmental Commission for Missing Persons, Prenkë Gjetaj.<br/>
<br/>
In the meeting was discussed on some of the key issues that challenge the process of clarifying the fate of missing persons. On this occasion, Minister Kuçi reiterated his support and the need to engage directly in the process as well as his commitment in driving this process until every missing person is found.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi urged all parties involved in the process to make a concrete plan with tasks and set deadlines within which these tasks must be fulfilled. He explained that such a concrete plan would help pushing the issue forward until finding each missing person in the last war, no matter their nationality. Furthermore, Minister Kuçi emphasized that it is essential that cooperation between the two sides in the interstate working group is continuous and serves as a forum for the exchange of information from both sides.<br/>
<br/>
The International Red Cross Committee, the Intergovernmental Commission for Missing Persons and Minister Kuçi emphasized that the current problems which mainly challenge and slow down this process, primarily deal with the lack of new information, which is closely linked to the non-providing of information from Serbia. <br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi added that what would help even more this process would be the full engagement of municipal officers for missing persons in each municipality. While recalling that these officials have started work on some of the municipalities in Kosovo, but the same cooperation is not found in all the municipalities. Therefore, he invited other actors who are responsible for this, to engage in this process and engage more in the employment and functioning of municipal officials on missing persons, because their proximity to citizens in each municipality would easier lead towards obtaining new information and thus clarifying the fate of missing persons.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi reiterated that this issue has already been raised in the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, and will be discussed in more detail in the next rounds. However, Minister Kuçi emphasized that although this issue will be discussed at the Prime Ministers level, it is extremely important that it remains more a humanitarian than a political issue. Therefore, despite the discussions on the political level, the interest of both sides in finding missing persons should be the main driver of cooperation at the technical level. </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/E51CB363-1A91-4B7A-B944-2E0EA43E0C0B.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/A11AF2B8-1CB5-44F7-BF3B-002D1DE69544.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/4C0EC68A-2B49-4DE0-AD9A-986FE21F2FB1.jpg "
The Swiss Government assistance given to Kosovo appreciated,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/7CE18911-F48C-43C4-B784-BCADF90C3064.jpg ,13/03/2013 17:28,"<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, today took part in the presentation of the Strategy for Kosovo 2013-2016, organized by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).<br/>

On this occasion, Minister Kuçi on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Kosovo thanked the people and the Government of Switzerland for the support they have given to the people and Government of Kosovo. <br/>
<br/>
&#34;The presentation of the Strategy for Kosovo 2013-2016 is a very good event and I have two reasons why I am here, firstly on behalf of the Government I would like to express our commitment for the project, and secondly, we have joined our priorities as Government with the support we receive from Switzerland. In many cases, we have together established our priorities and this is a very good opportunity to improve the lives of Kosovo people, &#34;said Kuçi.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi has appreciated this strategy due to the fact that it includes other non-majority communities in Kosovo.

The Ministry of Justice will soon finalize the Law on Amnesty,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/76C80CC9-83BE-45B7-B975-4AF38F171532.jpg ,12/03/2013 17:26,"<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, today met with the experts who have worked on the Draft Law on Amnesty.<br/>
<br/>
During the discussion, Minister Kuçi emphasized the importance of this law for our country and the inclusion of policies that he has made clear since 2011, when he took the initiative for this law.<br/>
<br/>
During the meeting, Minister Kuçi paid particular attention to the discussion of criminal offenses that will be excluded from the amnesty, as well as those which will be included.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi and the experts who have worked on this law, including EULEX experts, reaffirmed the necessity that this law has full social consensus and support from all the political parties represented in the Assembly. Consequently, added Kuçi, this law will be firstly presented to the political parties represented in the Assembly and then it will be further proceeded. In this regard, he emphasized that special attention will be given to the offences that will be excluded from the amnesty, so that serious criminal offences that violate social interests are not included in the amnesty.<br/>
<br/>
Kuçi Minister also clarified to the working group that this law is not directed towards the so-called &#34;amnesty for the north,&#34; as was said in the media. He explained that this law will contain certain criminal offenses which may be granted amnesty and that it is not dedicated to any particular part of the territory of the Republic of Kosovo adding that citizens across the country who meet conditions set by law can benefit from it.<br/>
<br/>
The Law on Amnesty, which is now in its final phase, will contain the general part which will define amnesty, conditions and procedures in accordance with the latest Constitutional Amendment, as well as the separate part which will count the criminal offenses for which amnesty is allowed and those that are not entitled to it.<br/>
<br/>
This law shall be proceeded to the Assembly upon the adoption of the Amnesty Constitutional Amendment, which has also been initiated by the Ministry of Justice. </p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/B65938F3-7FB7-4E09-B9DE-05433C4F1C03.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/76C80CC9-83BE-45B7-B975-4AF38F171532.jpg "

The congratulation telegram from Minister Kuçi says:<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dear Mr. Peci</strong><br/>
<br/>
Let me express my most sincere congratulations on your reappointment at the head of the Kosovo Judicial Council.<br/>
<br/>
I am convinced that your dedication towards the work of the judiciary in Kosovo, in the past and even now, would be the main driver towards the implementation of the judicial reforms initiated in order to achieve the aspired level of the rule of law.<br/>
<br/>
In your new mandate, I hope we will continue our devoted cooperation in ensuring the independence of the judiciary in every area of its scope. Our common task is extremely important, especially now, when the Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo is expected to approve the Constitutional Amendment for the selection of members of the Kosovo Judicial Council in accordance with the recommendations of the Council of Europe. The judiciary in Kosovo now more than ever has in its hands its independent future, which should be applied in improving services for the citizens of the Republic of Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
Given this vision, we must work in increasing the judicial accountability towards the citizens of the Republic of Kosovo. As we have discussed earlier, one of the ways this can be done is by increasing the transparency of the judiciary daily work, by holding public trials and mandatory publication of judgments at all levels of our judiciary. In this way, our judiciary will not only meet its obligations to be transparent to the public, but it will also make it easier to prove the great work that is being done every day in protecting and fulfilling the rights of citizens.<br/>
<br/>
In this regard, as the Minister of Justice, I look forward that our cooperation in this area aims to increase the citizens&#39; trust in justice and the judiciary of our country. The implementation of the reforms that we have jointly launched for a while now is a key element to achieve this ideal. Consequently, now that our justice system possesses nearly all the powerful and unique policies it needed for a long time, this year I will direct the Ministry of Justice towards a closer cooperation with the KJC in order to pay attention to the implementation of laws which we have brought together over the past couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
I firmly believe that one of the first steps that should be taken in this direction should be the reduction of the number of court cases. The Ministry of Justice, through the competencies it enjoys, is trying its best to help in this regard by functionalizing all means of alternative dispute resolution. While these initiatives are showing the first results, I believe that together we will succeed in shaping and realizing other ideas which I have already presented in our joint discussions. Among other things, we need to together consider the idea to address the problem of the large number of cases through the formation of a task force of judges who would be exclusively engaged for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to your cooperation, especially in amending the package of laws on the judiciary which we have started together in order to address the challenges that our judiciary has faced in the past. Among these challenges was mentioned several times the difficulty of recruiting the necessary number of judges in accordance with the needs of our country. Therefore, I rely on your cooperation in including into the legislation easier policies for the recruitment of judges and prosecutors in the future. The submission of more flexible conditions for judges will enable the engagement of new judges in courts, who would bring new ideas and experiences in the Kosovo judiciary.<br/>
<br/>
These new policies will excessively contribute in increasing the capacities of the judiciary, which I believe is also your main priority, along with other capacity building activities implemented together with the EULEX Mission in Kosovo. Now that the Ministry of Justice is drawing nearer to the completion of the project for the establishment of the Academy of Justice, let me remind you that the capacity building of judges will become much easier and more efficient.<br/>
<br/>
The common objectives of the EULEX mission, KJC and the Ministry of Justice for capacity building of the judiciary should serve as the main pillar of our joint work during your new mandate. By deepening the cooperation of these three institutions, we will strive together to achieve a smooth and easy transition of EULEX mission, followed by a gradual transfer of competencies from this mission to the local institutions.<br/>
<br/>
I am convinced that the reforms that we have already launched together, will achieve the desired success only through our joint and dedicated work. Let me once again express my sincere appreciation for your commitment towards the rule of law in the past as well as my full confidence that this commitment will not be lacking in your next mandate.<br/>
<br/>
As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, I would like to take this opportunity to express my absolute support in ensuring the welfare of the judiciary in Kosovo, as an unshakable foundation of the rule of law in our country.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I would like to express my highest consideration for the Kosovo Judicial Council, and wish you a successful work and many achievements.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

On this occasion, the Chief Executive Officer of the Agency for Gender Equality, Edona Hajrullahu announced that the Agency is in the process of drafting an action plan for the implementation of Resolution 1325 of the United Nations Security Council &#34;Women, Peace and Security&#34; and expressed commitment in finding an acceptable and favorable solution for those girls and women who are an equal part of Kosovo society. &#34;Our goal is that through the implementation of this national action plan, the victims of sexual violence, torture and other forms of violence of war have access to functional mechanisms for the protection, access to justice, rehabilitation and re-integration&#34; said Mrs. Hajrullahu.<br/>
<br/>
The Deputy Prime Minister, respectively the Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi said: &#34;there is still a special need to approach these women to justice, fortunately there have been many years now that Kosovo has created its own institutions, which are precisely profiled to facilitate this access to justice. They do a great and hard job. However, in a country where justice has been denied for decades and centuries, access to justice will never be enough - it is not something that can be fixed for a few years. Therefore, a greater work still needs to be done, &#34;said Kuçi.<br/>
<br/>
Kuçi said that the Government through the initiative of the Ministry of Justice has formed an inter-ministerial working group to deal with the past. According to him, the group will deal in details with the issue of repairing the damages to victims of sexual violence during the war in Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
Minister of European Integration, Çitaku said that raped women and girls during the war in Kosovo are a category that has so far been forgotten by society, family and institutions. After the war, the situation of these women has been miserable not only in material terms but also in social, health, legal, and above all spiritual terms. Our institutions must confront and give solution to this problem. For many of us the war ended 13 years ago, but to 20 thousand women and their families the struggle still continues.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the Deputy Minister of Labor and Social Welfare, Berat Luzha said that there is no evidence for women victims of rape during the war in Kosovo. </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/8C281982-07BF-431E-9670-D66C420E6FD3.jpg 
Kuçi: We are working to strengthen the accountability of the justice system,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D5EE8753-8B39-4F5E-A604-759E9D60DB14.jpg ,07/03/2013 17:19,"<p><strong> </strong>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi today participated in a roundtable discussion on &#34;The rights of citizens and accountability in the justice system&#34;, organized as part of the campaign &#34;Justice and citizens.&#34;<br/>
In this occasion Minister Kuçi said: &#34;It is increasingly important that discussions on justice, particularly on the judiciary, have more attention on the rights of citizens. Although justice and the rights of citizens are directly related to each other, it happens that reality often keeps them away from each other. It is therefore very important that, like today, they are always discussed as two closely related issues, or dependent to each other.<br/>
<br/>
We are all witnessing the fact that the Kosovo judiciary does not function as we would like to. As a result, citizens often feel that their rights cannot be realized in the best way and this causes disappointment among them.<br/>
<br/>
But, it should also be noted that the judicial and legal system in Kosovo has gone through a very difficult phase. Moreover, attempts to reform it constantly, though well-intentioned, have often made our judicial system spend much time dedicated to reforms. Large number of cases, along with many problems inherited from the past, has made the work of our judicial system much harder than any other system in the region or elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
So far, this has made our judicial system understood by our citizens. The transition through which Kosovo has passed, along with the judiciary, has directed a great job towards the full safeguard of independence of the judiciary and the prosecution, in order to ensure that Kosovo will not suffer any negative effects of transition, like many other countries around us.<br/>
Since getting the Ministry of Justice under my leadership, I have invested a lot of time and work to ensure that the judiciary and the prosecution have ideal conditions for a well functioning. In addition to the fact that this power is already separated from the executive and functions separately, our Ministry has proposed a constitutional amendment, which was approved by the Constitutional Court, and which will soon be adopted. This amendment will enable the majority of the Judicial Council members to be chosen by the judiciary and not by the Assembly. This, however, will add even more independence to the judiciary.<br/>
<br/>
It should be added that although the Judicial and Prosecutorial Councils formally submit their budget to the Ministry of Finance in order to be introduced in the Budget Law, their budget requests, at least over the past three years, have never been rejected. Salaries of judges and prosecutors are connected with those of Ministers and state leaders, in order to ensure that the position of a judge is not inferior to other state positions.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, it has been invested heavily in the proper legal infrastructure, so that judges and prosecutors have all the necessary means, all the legal power that can be given in order to enable a better functioning in protecting the citizens&#39; rights.<br/>
<br/>
However, it must be admitted that in the name of independence, the accountability of the judiciary often missed, but this is where it should be taken very carefully.<br/>
<br/>
I think that in the coming period, the judiciary should pay more attention to the transparency of the work it does. It should be noted that our judges and prosecutors are doing a very good job. Unfortunately, only their errors are reflected in the media and among citizens. Therefore, the judiciary must do more to convey the work that they do to the public, to prove that a good job is being done indeed.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that the judiciary has a system of self-improvement and this has already started showing its results. The case of Diana Kastrati, decided by the Constitutional Court proves such a thing. I think that self-correction of the judiciary in Kosovo will continue to serve even more in the future and this will make people feel safer at home and feel that their institutions address their concerns appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
In the amendments that the Ministry of Justice is doing together with the Judiciary and Prosecution in the package of laws on the judiciary, is being planned to introduce the obligation for courts to publish all their judgments on the website. This will not only make their work more transparent and more accessible to the citizens, but also will self-oblige judges and prosecutors to care about the quality of their decision-making.<br/>
<br/>
All these are made so that the judiciary does not lose its accountability towards the citizens of Kosovo. And until this is done automatically by the judiciary itself, other branches of the central government should take care in making it a legal norm. So, today I remind you that we are working hard in this direction and this is done in order to increase the credibility of the judiciary. The American political activist Thomas Paine cited &#34;a body of people who does not report to anyone is not to be believed by anyone&#34; and we would not like this to happen to our judiciary.&#34;  </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D5EE8753-8B39-4F5E-A604-759E9D60DB14.jpg 
The meeting of the Joint Rule of Law Cordination Board is held,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/5D623670-0CF8-4F73-BD8E-405C0A3F440F.jpg ,07/03/2013 17:18,"<p>Today was held the regular meeting of the Joint Rule of Law Cordination Board, which was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, the Head of EULEX in Kosovo, Bernd Borchardt and the Head of EU in Kosovo, Samuel Zbogar, and was also attended by the European Integration Minister, Vlora Çitaku, Minister of Internal Affairs, Bajram Rexhepi, the Director of Kosovo Police as well as other leaders of justice institutions.<br/>
<br/>
At this meeting, it was discussed on the achievements set by the compact agreement.<br/>
<br/>
After the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi explained that it was discussed on improving the rule of law in the Republic of Kosovo, expressing mutual commitment in certain areas of justice, police and customs.<br/>
<br/>
Kuçi added that there are mutual commitments, merging of priorities, particularly in the implementation of the compact agreement, which helps in the coordination of activities in the field of rule of law and thus helps the process of integration into the European Union, in particular the process of visa liberalization as well as the stabilization and association process.<br/>
<br/>
Deputy Prime Minister emphasized that now are met the short-term criteria of the visa liberalization report and this is highly valued by the European Union institutions in Kosovo, therefore this enables a deeper cooperation with the European Commission, the EU Office in Kosovo and EULEX in improving law and order, as well as in all other areas.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the public harassment towards the prosecutors and judges, Kuçi condemned the phenomenon of public &#34;lynching&#34; for reasons that are totally unprofessional and hinder their work. He called the prosecutorial authorities to investigate these cases under the law and as soon as possible, and to see if any criminal offense of obstructing official persons (prosecutors) has been caused through unfair public harassment in the media.<br/>
<br/>
Borchardt said that judges and prosecutors should work without any fear or unjustified denigrating because this is a very important issue.<br/>
<br/>
The Head of EULEX, Bernd Borchardt added: &#34;This is an important moment for Kosovo in improving the rule of law. Together we have made progress, but there is still work to be done. As I have said it earlier, we all have our responsibilities here, and EULEX will focus on increasing joint and strengthening executive activities. This reflects our partnership, builds capacities and supports our gradual withdrawal &#34;.<br/>
<br/>
The Head of the EU Office in Kosovo, Samuel Zbogar said: &#34;The meeting of the Joint Rule of Law Coordination Board has been reconfirmed once again as a mechanism of partnership between Kosovo and the European Union. Regarding the rule of law, I think that in every meeting we have, we confirm that this is the essence of dialogue, the essence of evaluating the achievements and progress. This is also the place where we discuss on future activities related to the rule of law and in this way I think that this mechanism is improving as an important element for Kosovo and the European Union.” </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/5D623670-0CF8-4F73-BD8E-405C0A3F440F.jpg 
MoJ publishes expenses on a weekly basis (Clarification),https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/D14BFD48-ABFD-4C05-A46C-9D1EB2F44895.jpg ,06/03/2013 17:17,"<p>Today, in some electronic and print media has been published the information stating that Deputy Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, during 2011, spent 13,078.85 euro on official lunches and dinners, but without clarifying that this amount included expenses of other subordinate departments of the Ministry of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
The Ministry of Justice explains to the public that the total amount spent during the year 2011, published as cabinet costs of this Ministry, are not only the expenses made by the Minister, but in fact include all costs incurred by many other subordinate departments.<br/>
<br/>
During 2011, the Ministry of Justice has developed several important activities, such as: the International War Crimes Conference, organized by the War Crimes Research Institute, various negotiations with delegations from other countries on international legal cooperation agreements, the organization of awarding the prize for justice &#34;Sali Çekaj&#34;, visits made to the Ministry of Justice from Ministers and delegations of various European countries and beyond, a number of ceremonies regarding the establishment and functionalism of the notary and mediation institution, and many other events. The expenditures of all these events are part of the abovementioned amount and therefore this should not be construed as expenses from the Minister.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, holds an unusually high number of meetings with partners in Kosovo, hosts a large number of state leaders from around the world, which makes inevitable the need for formal lunches and dinners. In addition, if this amount is divided into 12 months, it comes out that the amount spent is thousands of euros lower than the amount allocated for these expenses.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the Ministry of Justice, trying to be as transparent as possible for the expenses made, publishes all the expenses of each department on a weekly basis on its website, ranging from the cost of the Minister and his cabinet.<br/>
<br/>
Transparency of costs publications on a weekly basis by the Ministry of Justice has been evaluated in the analysis titled &#34;Kosovo Budget - transparency and budget reporting forms&#34;, published by the Institute for Advanced Studies (GAP).  </p>",
Minister Kuçi discussed on the implementation of MoJ objectives,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/8EBD37AC-8BEE-47C2-998D-29B221E8D0CA.jpg ,04/03/2013 17:16,"<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Prof. Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, today held a joint meeting with the Deputy Ministers, the Secretary General, the Directors of departments, agencies and offices of the Ministry of Justice.<br/>

<br/>
The Minister spoke about the importance of the implementation of the legislative program of the Ministry of Justice provided for this year, as well as the amending, supplementing and harmonization of laws.<br/>
<br/>
Minister Kuçi has urged a greater commitment in informing the public about the powers and responsibilities of the Ministry of Justice. In this regard, he said that citizens should be informed that the Ministry of Justice is independent and has no executive powers over the courts and prosecution.<br/>
<br/>
He also focused on the importance of informing the public on the establishment and functioning of the Ministry of Justice notarial system and mediation system. </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/8EBD37AC-8BEE-47C2-998D-29B221E8D0CA.jpg

<br/>
Minister Kuçi highly appreciated the work of international institutions such as EULEX, the EU Office, the US Embassy, and many other institutions which strongly support the daily work of the Kosovo institutions.<br/>

<br/>
It was also said that the electronic monitoring of alternative sanctions is the most efficient method to monitor the re-socialization of persons sentenced to such penalties.<br/>

Speech of Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi in the Inter-ministerial Commission for Public Administration Reform,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/ED9CC5AC-463B-4DAA-9CEA-76789BABED6C.jpg ,11/07/2012 16:44,"<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Professor Dr. Hajredin Kuçi, today has participated in the regular meeting of the Inter-ministerial Commission for Public Administration Reform.<br/>
<br/>
At this meeting, where participants were ministers, deputy ministers of the Cabinet and representatives of international institutions, the Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi said &#34;As you are aware, in the overall spectrum of public administration reform we have approved a multitude of laws and documents of significant strategic development in this field. Without leaving aside the importance of laws and other strategic developing documents, where this time I would like to highlight the Law on State Administration, Civil Service Law, the Law on Salaries of Civil Servants, the Strategy for Public Administration Reform and the relevant Action Plan.<br/>
<br/>
The laws in question contribute to the re-organization of our institutions, in redressing the functions of our administration staff and as a key element, through these laws, is enabled to have the same compensation for the same work.<br/>
<br/>
In order to implement these laws and to translate written words into performed deeds, there is an inalienable need to draft and approve all the regulations deriving from them. Therefore, I invite the responsible institutions for drafting these laws, to raise the level of responsibility and to consider as an obligation the respect of the law.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the Law on Salaries of Civil Servants regulates only a part of the salary system in the Republic of Kosovo, but most of the other categories of salaries for the public sector remain to be regulated by primary legislation. Hence, on this occasion, I invite the responsible institutions for the regulation of this field to draft proposals about modalities on harmonizing the salary system and propose a clear framework of this system in the Republic of Kosovo.<br/>
<br/>
Also, besides the Strategy for Public Administration Reform, we have already approved the Action Plan and the Government has made a decision for the structures responsible for the implementation of these documents. Hereupon, I invite the responsible institutions for implementation of activities and constitution of the relevant working groups and subgroups - according to the government decision to start their work as soon as possible and results to be reported soon.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the compelling power that legislation and the government developing policies provide can be successful only if they are monitored, supervised and reported in an authentic and accurate way. They also may be postponed, when, in case of non-respect of our commitments, sanctioning measures proportionate to the damage caused are taken. That is why, to enable this process, the general area of inspection should be a no-compromise axis of our efforts for a state of law. The initial step in this direction has already been taken by initiating the drafting of the Draft Law on inspections and the Administrative Inspection. But, I am aware that the greatest work remains to be done - which means that it requires maximum commitment and dedication to finalize the drafting, approval and implementation in order to have a functional system for inspection and with regulatory premises for accountability.<br/>
<br/>
But, of course, beside the control system we must record progress towards the principles of better regulation. This means moving from quantity to quality - through regulatory impact assessment, to move from the high cost to the lower cost - through rationalization of expenditures, moving from the long procedures to the shorter ones - through simplification of administrative barriers, and the effect of these measures to measure through the most sophisticated instruments (as for ex. CAF - Common Assessment Framework).<br/>
<br/>
These additional tasks as well as many others which I did not mention, but will inevitably contribute to the modernization of our public administration, seek new responsibilities and consequently additional knowledge. To acquire this knowledge relevant trainings are needed. However, to make sure that this knowledge is absorbed from the persons responsible for the realization of their duties, it is imperative that trainings are made compulsory. Moreover, according to the trend of developments in the public administrations of European countries (the family that we intend to become a part of), raising the educational level of a category of our public servants turns out to be one of the major challenges that we will have to face in a not very distant future. Therefore, strengthening the role and capacity of the Kosovo Institute for Public Administration, is not only our wish but also our necessity.<br/>
<br/>
Another aim towards reforming the public administration, not less important, is also the fighting of corruption and ensuring transparency and ethics in public administration. Currently, the Republic of Kosovo possesses legislation and institutions adequate enough to combat these phenomena. But parallel to the actual lighting of the reality we must work in a positive change of mentality. To do so, we shall commit that all public administration institutions draft plans of integrity. These plans will serve to assess the risk of corruption in advance, to identify it since the early stages and that the impact sanctioning is clear to all. Or, in brief, integrity plans will serve us more for prevention than consequence. &#34;</p>","https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/ED9CC5AC-463B-4DAA-9CEA-76789BABED6C.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/E8A75D06-EE0B-4D38-BF29-3234EC1A9E0B.jpg ,https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/ED9CC5AC-463B-4DAA-9CEA-76789BABED6C.jpg "

<br/>
&#34;Jusuf Gërvalla, Kadri Zeka and Bardhosh Gërvalla are trinomial that marks the idea of political union of organized forces after the 1981 demonstrations. It is this philosophy and the model of activity which made them becoming a serious obstacle of anti Albanian  segments in West and elsewhere. The idea of creating a common front of political forces in Kosovo and in the West, was considered a serious danger to political circles and the yugoslav secret services, which resulted in organizing and carrying out the assassination(attack) on these   three activists, &#34;said Kuçi.<br/>

According to Deputy Prime Minister Kuçi, although was still not shed the light on this  political crime the fall of brothers Gërvalla and Kadri Zeka, their name, work and fall for the national movement, for young men and women, for a whole generation became inspiration, guide and determination to strengthen the movement illegal.

<br/>
Rule of law and justice sector in general is known to be areas where society and the state of Kosovo will face the most challenges. The challenges to be faced with hard and constant work and.<br/>
<br/>
I am convinced that I am not the first nor the only one that I consider that an extremely large burden on the direction of achieving our aspirations for the rule of law belongs exactly to  the judiciary, with particular emphasis on those who put it in movement : prosecutors.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad that our prosecutors offices today present their work done during the previous t year, with the confidence that this will contribute to the transparency of their work. <br/>
<br/>
We are  witnessing the critics which are not rare that are made towards the work of our prosecutors. But at the same time, we are also witnesses of the fact that during the past year, our prosecutors are facing various difficulties, ranging from materials to safety at work.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the Ministry that I lead, the main priority has  cooperation and coordination with the justice system, particularly the Kosovo Judicial Council (KJC), the Kosovo Prosecutorial Council (KPC), the Supreme Court (SC) and international institutions of justice in Kosovo. To achieve greater efficiency in this regard, we have regular meetings where we get informed about the latest events in their work, discuss problems and challenges we face and, more importantly, we work together on solving them in most effective way.<br/>
<br/>
Ministry of Justice, among the first steps taken towards improving the work of our Prosecutors, has been the agreement of understanding with which it was agreed between our Ministry and Prosecutorial Council for the transfer of personnel, files and assets from MoJ to KPC. This agreement is intended for better and self management of Prosecutor&#39;s offices in the future, and it shows further commitment of the Ministry of Justice as part of the executive on power sharing, as required by our Constitution. In the course of activities in this regard, the Ministry of Justice  is committed  in the implementation of the Law on Prosecution Council. We are currently recruiting 45 new prosecutors, who will facilitate the work of those who are already part of the prosecution, expect this it will increase their efficiency and bring enthusiasm to your work constantly. When talking about future generations of prosecutors, should however be noted that we have already begun the work of establishing the Academy of Justice, in order to invest in the  future of the prosecution offices, there where exactly emanates their careers: the education<br/>
<br/>
Our prosecution offices  will take special place in the Justice Advisory Council, which is newly established, at the initiative of the Ministry of Justice, in order to advance the justice system and rule of law, implementing the strategies of judicial and prosecutorial bodies, ensuring the conditions, proposing and undertaking measures in the field of Judiciary and prosecution. Ministry of Justice has already begun functioning of this Council, and will soon begin concrete work to fulfill the purposes of its establishment. Justice Council aims to include specific ideas of all relevant stakeholders, including representatives of executive bodies, the judiciary, prosecution, international organizations and civil society, the need for substantial changes that will improve working conditions, among other, the prosecution. The establishment of this Council, in combination with the daily work of our Ministry, once again demonstrate my personal commitment but also the commitment of this government to invest as much as possible in material and physical security of prosecutors.<br/>
<br/>
The first results of this commitment Have already begun to be noticed: last week we made the decision substantial allowance for  prosecutors and supporting staff of the Special Prosecutors office of the Republic of Kosovo. As a very important step, these allowances are in fact only one of the first steps among many of them to be taken continuously to improve your working conditions.<br/>
<br/>
On our way to improve your working conditions, we haven’t avoid the legal infrastructure under which is managed your daily work. In cooperation with international actors, Criminal Codes are being reviewed in order to be reflected in the most known modern and sophisticated international practices . In this field, the cooperation is being done with a range of international experts, so that our prosecutors be given the strength and the tools needed to fight crime in every area in the most efficient way, always respecting the human rights as it is in most democratic countries in the world.<br/>
<br/>
However, to achieve all the aims of our society for the rule of law, is required your highest dedication in carrying out your duties in the most diligent and correct way.<br/>
<br/>
Societies in general and especially the society and our state have always been eager for justice, maintain very high professional and moral standards for prosecutors.<br/>
<br/>
Deciding in a very famous case, the Supreme Court of the United States, in its decision states that &#34;... the prosecutor is not simply a representative of one party to the dispute, but representatives of sovereignty, and for him the obligation to govern correct is as important as self-governance in general, and his interest in a criminal proceeding, therefore, is not to win the case, but decide correct (fair). Thus, in a very special sense, he is servant of the law, the dual purpose of which is that guilt should not remain unpunished, nor innocence to suffer&#34;<br/>
<br/>
I have strong confidence in the bright future of our prosecutors office, and today in front of you  I want again to remind the maximum commitment of the Ministry of Justice and the Government of Kosovo to support prosecution, and at the same time I  ask your support with hard work in this direction, which is not only the basis of our European path, but first as a field with direct impact on the lives of each of us. </p>",https://md.rks-gov.net/desk/inc/media/A698923D-C985-4A67-801B-C4959C912C1E.jpg

Justice (iusticia) implies the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of the United Nations for Human Rights and many international conventions. These rights must be respect not only by the state institutions but also by individual to individual, because this is the only way to gain the culture for human rights and their respect by most of the population, and then since from the early school; inter human tolerance will be promoted, interethnic and interfaith, all aimed at building a healthy society, democratic that respects the rule of law.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, the provision of justice, on the other hand, is one of the basic elements in the rule of law and ensuring its continuity and its base in law is a necessary condition for implementation of this principle in practice, as one of the most important principles of any state and democratic society. The consequent respect of the human rights and freedoms is enabled by providing Justice, as well as the very important element-the exercise of state power by state institutions in full compliance with the Constitution and law will be achieved.<br/>
<br/>
The operation of the rule of law implies at the same time the independence and impartiality of judicial institutions, judiciary and prosecution, as important pillar of any state in fighting crime and other non-legal actions in general, prevention of the self judgment, guaranteeing social peace and a series of other rights.<br/>
<br/>
How important is the provision of justice speaks the sentence that I detached from a decision rendered by the tribunal for war crimes in former Yugoslavia, where a judge, just by using the independence of the judge and the right reason to the case of taking a decision said quote: &#34;Let justice happen, even if the world will turn up side down&#34;. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In continuity I would like to mention some elements of the citizenship principle of the law such as: the Democratic Constitution, recognition and respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms, separation of powers and the exercise of state power in accordance with the Constitution and law. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of functioning of the rule of law Kosovo so far has made very large and important steps, especially after its declaration of independence. Thus, the Assembly of Kosovo has adopted the Democratic Constitution, which contains all elements required for the fulfillment of the principle of rule of law, has adopted hundreds of laws and it is in the approval process is in many other laws that are in the parliamentary procedure, which are based on the Constitution and are in harmony with EU standards and the highest international standards, which apply in practice by state institutions and Kosovo society. <br/>
<br/>
As for the rights and fundamental freedoms, the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Kosovo they have included not only the rights that should have every democratic constitution, but moreover, has moved many steps forward, by recognizing the communities minority rights guaranteed not only by the international conventions but also the additional rights starting from their involvement in the parliament, to vote twice, known as &#34;vote  Badinter, in certain cases by the Constitution and the law. This is known to all the international communities, as it is known that these rights are implemented in practice. But behold, despite the guarantee of these rights, may happen that any citizen of Kosovo does not want to use these rights. It remains to hope that this phenomenon will not last as long. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Kosovo has completed entirely another important element of the rule of rule of law. It is in relation with the full separation of powers: legislative, executive and judicial power. <br/>
<br/>
When it comes to judicial power, this power under the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo is unique, independent, fair, apolitical, and impartial and ensures equal access in the courts for all citizens of Kosovo. Therefore, it is the duty of all institutions of Kosovo, the natural and legal persons of all its citizens to respect the independence of the judiciary. However, regarding the power and work of courts and prosecutors, there is much work to be done. First of all the corruption is the first to be fought, which unfortunately, is present in the bodies of justice. With the full combat and elimination of corruption, with non violation of the independence of the institutions of justice and the appointment of sufficient number of holders of judicial functions, not to delay the court proceedings and to work in returning back the confidence in the courts and prosecution . Then, as soon as possible should be the laws on judicial reform shall be adopted, which have been submitted for approval since March 17 2009 and to perform the appointment of holders of the functions of institutions of justice. <br/>
<br/>
Surely that this has been done so far for the justice and the rule of law in Kosovo and this is not enough and much remains to be desired also for the fact that the state of Kosovo is new, and it is in the construction and aims the membership in Euro-Atlantic structures and other relevant international organizations. <br/>
<br/>
For the justice there is much to say and written, but I concluded my speech with opinion of mine that can not be called democratic the country which is not able to provide to its citizens rights and fundamental freedoms and if it does not respect the principle of rule of law state. <br/>
<br/>
At the end of my speech I want to warmly thank those in various forms are helping the justice in Kosovo and helped to organize the record of Justice, among them: ABA / ROL, USAID, UNDP in, EULEX, Kosovo Judicial Council, Kosovo Chamber of Advocates, the Association of Judges and Prosecutors Association of Kosovo, the Commission for Legal Aid, Dean of the Law Faculty in Pristina, RTK many other subjects. <br/>

In her speech she said &#34;under the Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo, the judicial system in Kosovo is unique and indivisible, is an independent and impartial and ensures equal access to the courts for all citizens of Kosovo&#34;. <br/>
Likewise, The Minister of Justice noted that the independence of the judiciary and prosecutors is guaranteed even under the operation of the Provisional Judicial prosecutorial Council and, a mechanism such that after adopting a package of laws, which will begin in justice reform , will be split between the judiciary and prosecution, with the establishment of the Judicial Council and Prosecutorial Council. <br/>

<br/>
Taking part in the session, which was treated in the fight against corruption, Minister of Justice began her discussion with  counting of all laws, which are aimed at preventing and combating corruption, as one of the challenges raised in the Progress report 2009.

<br/>
It is worth mentioning that the Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia Ivica Daqiq tried to politicize the conference, demanding that before any topic that will be addressed at the conference, at first should be heard the representative of UNMIK and Kosovo should be added UNMIK. When Minister Kelmendi insisted that to not happen this, then the organizer of the Conference urged that to remove from the table of all participants the names of state and ministers attending the conference, so  the Minister Kelmendi as all other participants discussed the topics that were subject to treatment in the conference. In a sign of revolt, Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia Daqiq got the floor  to the organizer and said will leave the  conference , however, with the insistence of the organizers,  he remained in the Conference room and took part in the discussion. <br/>
